## 2026-10-02 - Durable RPC input metadata (desktop#1325, senpi#1971)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: prompt and queued-input options carry client identity; prepared queue insertion has a write-before-enqueue callback; native user messages and ordered queue records preserve identity; restored accepted input bypasses input transforms. Queue consumption uses client identity when present.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/client-message-identity.ts`: bounded identity parsing and shared prepared-input metadata.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` previously discarded client identity before native queue insertion and matched consumed input only by text. Replayed deliveries and equal-text messages could not be distinguished.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/client-message-identity.ts` keeps the metadata shared by RPC admission, native messages, and queue restoration.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` owns native queue mutation and prompt construction; only that boundary can persist prepared input before acknowledging or enqueuing it.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/client-message-identity.ts` defines transport-to-core metadata that must survive extension replacement.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: input option types, prepared user-message construction, queue insertion and consumption. Extension loading and permission hooks are not changed.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/client-message-identity.ts`: new module.

## 2026-10-02 - Accept Ctrl+V in direct Warp-on-WSL sessions

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts`: `app.clipboard.pasteImage` defaults to both `ctrl+v` and `alt+v` in direct Warp-on-WSL sessions, using the existing hardened TUI session detector. Other terminal defaults and explicit user overrides are unchanged.

### Why

- WSL selected only the Windows `alt+v` binding, so a delivered Ctrl+V byte never reached clipboard handling even when the Windows clipboard image could be read successfully.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The app binding table controls clipboard dispatch and its displayed hints. An optional extension shortcut cannot repair the shared default for every composer.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the TUI import and `app.clipboard.pasteImage` row in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts`.

## 2026-10-01 - Queued settings saves no longer block the UI on a held lock (senpi#2508)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `FileSettingsStorage` gains `tryWithLock` (write only when the lock is free right now) and `withLockAsync` (the same locked read-merge-publish, waiting with timers). A queued save writes synchronously when the lock is free, as before, and otherwise waits for it asynchronously.

### Why

Saving the tip history on a turn waited for a held settings lock with `Atomics.wait` on the UI thread: up to 2.9 s of frozen typing whenever another senpi process held the lock, which is normal with several sessions running.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The settings store's write path is core.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `SettingsStorage`, `FileSettingsStorage.withLock` and the lock helpers beside it, `enqueueWrite`, `persistScopedSettings`, `save`, `saveProjectSettings`.

## 2026-10-01 - One materialized copy of the session, released at idle (senpi#2508)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-resident-store.ts`: `externalize` remembers values that came out without resident tokens, and `materialize` returns those as is instead of deep-copying them.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `getBranch` reuses the compact view's materialized entries (`_fromCompactView`), and `holdsMaterializedHistory()` reports a held full-history view of a trimmed mirror.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the idle release moves into the public `releaseSettledSessionMemory()`, which also drops the views when a full-history view is held.

### Why

Every view deep-copied each entry, the branch copied the session a second time, and a trimmed mirror's full-history view pinned the whole file's entries across idle. At 50,000 entries that held about 60 MB more than at 10,000 (1.6x); after this the ratio is 1.04x, and context builds no longer copy entries that carry no resident strings.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The resident store, the session views and the idle settlement are core internals.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-resident-store.ts`: `externalize`, `materialize`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `getBranch`, `_extendBranchCache`, `dropMaterializedCaches`, the fields beside `historyView`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_emitAgentIdleAfterDeferredTurns`, `releaseSettledSessionMemory`.

## 2026-10-01 - Entry ids stay unique after a compaction trim; duplicated ids no longer hang open or /tree (senpi#2508, senpi#1247)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: the ids of entries a compaction trims from the resident mirror stay reserved (`trimmedIds`), and every `generateId` call checks them along with the mirror's index. The leaf-path walks (`buildSessionPath`, `getBranch`, `hasBranchEntry`) stop at the first revisited entry, and `getTree()` attaches each node once.

### Why

`generateId` only checked the trimmed mirror, so a later entry could reuse the id of an entry that was trimmed from memory but is still in the file. On the next resume the reused id closed the parent chain into a cycle and `buildSessionPath` never returned, so the TUI stayed on "opening session" (seen with a 50,000-entry compacted session). Files that already contain duplicated ids (#1247) also froze `/tree` because `getTree()` attached the same node repeatedly.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Id generation and the path/tree walks are the session store itself.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `generateId` call sites, `_trimMirrorAfterCompaction`, `buildSessionPath`, `getBranch`, `hasBranchEntry`, `getTree`, and the fields beside `mirrorTrimmed`.

## 2026-10-01 - Per-turn session reads extend instead of re-copying the session (senpi#2508)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: the compact mirror view, the full-history view of a trimmed mirror, the leaf branch and the current projection are materialized once and then extended by the entries appended since (keyed by the mirror array identity and length; anything that rebuilds the mirror assigns a new array and invalidates them). A trimmed mirror no longer re-reads and re-parses the session file for `getEntries()`; `projectSession` builds the leaf path once.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: a turn-end boundary with no drafts projects the session itself instead of cloning the branch into an in-memory manager.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/chains.ts`: one canonicalization pass asks each provider's fallback eligibility once, and `rankFamilyModels` filters by family before asking.

### Why

Every background-triggered turn copied the whole session several times (context checks, hook previews, stop-hook history scans, footer usage) and re-parsed the skill MCP declaration files, and the first fallback check re-read provider settings per model; each copy blocked input for tens to hundreds of milliseconds in a 10k-entry session.

### Why an extension could not handle it

These are the session store and the turn-preparation paths in the core.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `getBranch`, `getEntries`, `_getCompactEntries`, `buildSessionProjection`, `buildSessionContext`, `projectSession`, `buildContextEntries`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_buildBoundaryContext`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/chains.ts`: `authTiers`.

## 2026-10-01 - Context usage is computed once per message change (senpi#2508)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `getContextUsage()` memoizes its result on the runtime message array, its length and last message, the branch leaf and the model window; the computation moved unchanged to `_computeContextUsage()`.

### Why

The footer calls it on every frame; after a compaction it re-estimated tokens over every message (19% of each frame in a 50k-entry session).

### Why an extension could not handle it

The footer reads the session's own usage API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `getContextUsage`.

## 2026-10-01 - Share shipped package resolution with read permissions (#2513)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: bundled extension definitions and package resolution move into `packages/coding-agent/src/core/bundled-resources.ts`, with the source-module identity guard generalized for its new location. The shared resolver also locates shipped payload roots for permission classification; development runs trust declared asset directories rather than the whole source checkout.

### Why

- The loader and permissions must agree on the actual installed, snapshot, packaged or compiled sidecar package, instead of trusting a hardcoded application path.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` resolves the engine-owned packages before their extensions can contribute resources.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: the bundled package resolver and its imports.

## 2026-10-01 - Each session owns its tool-search service (senpi#2509)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the session adopts the tool-search service its extension load created (`_adoptToolSearchService`, called right after the `ExtensionRunner` is built), disposes the previous generation's service on reload and its own on `dispose()`, and reads the catalog, removed-tool hints and native-injection failure through that service instead of the module-level `getToolSearchService()`.

### Why

- Outside the RPC host the builtin rebound one shared service to each loading session, so when another in-process session closed, the live session's `context` and `before_provider_request` hooks threw the stale-ctx error and its tool search stopped working.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The session must own and retire the service of each extension generation, which only the host knows.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts`: the tool-search service field and lookups, `dispose()`, and the line after `new ExtensionRunner` in `_buildRuntime`.

## 2026-10-01 - Veto configuration reload during prompt admission

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the existing reload veto checks the prompt-admission hold before and after asynchronous extension gates, and reload rechecks admission immediately before teardown. The shared `isIdle` behavior remains unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/reload-veto.ts`: owns the extracted reload decision and preserves extension cancellation reasons.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: once the veto passes, `reload` holds the session work barrier until the rebuilt runtime is bound, so a prompt submitted during teardown starts on the new generation instead of the retiring one.

### Why

- A watched configuration change could request a reload during the first request's admission, retiring extension APIs that the request was still using. This complements the lazy-activation generation reset in senpi#2506 and covers the first-message failure reported in oh-my-openagent#9365.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` owns the synchronous admission hold. Changing shared idleness also changes hook submission and queued continuation behavior, so admission is checked only at the reload boundary.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`, `reload` and `checkReloadVeto`.

## 2026-10-01 - Skill catalog: read a skill when it would change the work, not on a loose match (senpi#2505)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts`: the catalog preamble (both the `read` and the `bash` variants) says "load a skill's file when its description matches the task and its instructions would change the work; keyword overlap or mere availability is not a reason." instead of "whenever its description even loosely matches the task - loading an irrelevant skill costs little; missing a relevant one degrades the work".

### Why

- GPT-6 Astra obeys the old sentence literally: in three same-day review sessions with an identical opener it read 6-8 SKILL.md files before its first action while Claude Fable read none, and a 2026-09-27 A/B measured the catalog as the largest pre-action cost (removing it cut time and cost by about 40%). OpenAI's guide warns that Astra "can be more sensitive to instructions contained in skills and other files"; codex's own template says "Do not use a skill based solely on keywords, superficial relevance, or the availability of a potentially applicable skill". The new sentence is the codex stance and is token-neutral.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The preamble is rendered by the core skills loader for every session.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `skills.ts` `formatSkillsForPrompt` lines array.

## 2026-10-01 - A busy credential read never becomes model availability (senpi#2487)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`: `reload()` returns `"loaded" | "busy" | "failed"`. A `CredentialStoreBusyError` before the store has ever loaded marks the in-memory credentials as a placeholder (`isCredentialStoreBusy()`) and bumps `getBusyReadCount()`; async reads that fall back to the never-loaded placeholder bump the same count. A busy read after a successful load still serves the last loaded credentials. A store constructed on an auth.json the process already loaded starts from the shared read state instead of `{}`, including after a repaired or migrated load that left the revision unset; it skips its own read only when the revision matches, and otherwise still reads, so a busy startup read keeps the shared credentials.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/runtime-credentials.ts` (fork-only): `busyReadCount()` exposes the backing store's count (0 for stores that never report contention).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: the full and per-provider availability passes compare the count across their reads; a pass that answered from the busy placeholder publishes nothing, leaves `availabilityInitialized` unset and records an availability error, so the next refresh re-reads the store.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`: the live-auth fallback of `getAvailable()` and `hasConfiguredAuth()` re-reads the store when its credentials are a busy placeholder.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`: the app-server builds its `model/list` registry once per process; when auth.json was locked past the 1 s sync budget at that first read, the registry answered from `{}` and never read again, so `model/list` stayed empty until restart. A second `AuthStorage.create()` on an already-loaded path skipped its read and had the same empty answer without any contention; after a repaired or migrated load (revision unset) it could not skip, and a busy startup read left it with the empty placeholder.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/runtime-credentials.ts`: async reads swallow the busy error and return the placeholder, so an availability pass completed "successfully" with no providers and set `availabilityInitialized`, and snapshot consumers served the empty list.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`: the busy state is decided inside the credential store's lock handling and consumed by the availability snapshot that every surface (app-server, TUI, RPC, startup resolution) reads; no extension hook sits between them.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`: the `AuthStorage` constructor, `updateReadState()`, `reload()` and the catch blocks of `readLatestData()`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: the guard after the sequence checks in `runAvailabilityRefresh()` and `refreshProviderAvailability()`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`: the fallback branch of `getAvailable()` and `hasConfiguredAuth()`.

## 2026-10-01 - Retire lazy activators on extension reload (omo#9365)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: reset lazy-tool activation registrations before binding a rebuilt extension runtime.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/lazy-tool-activation.ts`: extracted deferred-tool activation ownership and existing exposure fallback from the session orchestrator.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` retained retired tool-search callbacks after reload. A deferred computer tool then consulted the old generation on its next capabilities call.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` owns registration and runtime replacement for every extension. Only the host can discard callbacks before binding the replacement generation.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: lazy activation field, activation dispatch, extension core binding, and runtime rebuild.

## 2026-10-01 - Explicit command argument requirements (senpi#2479)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts`: model, thinking, rename and login arguments are explicitly optional; import requires a path.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/prompt-templates.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts`: load boolean `requires-arguments` frontmatter; when it is unset, a declared `argument-hint` means arguments are required.

### Why

Picker Enter must submit commands that work without arguments; those declare it explicitly, while a hint alone keeps the old wait-for-input behavior.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Builtin definitions and resource loaders own the metadata consumed before extension dispatch.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts`: builtin definitions.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/prompt-templates.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts`: resource interfaces and frontmatter loading.

## 2026-09-30 - Preserve ambient request authentication for auxiliary requests (senpi#2441)

### What changed

- `model-registry.ts`: `getApiKeyAndHeaders()` now carries the provider resolver's `ambient` marker in a successful request-auth result.

### Why

- Normal turns accept a resolved provider auth result even when the provider signs or authenticates the request later and therefore supplies neither an API key nor credential headers. Auxiliary callers need that same decision without treating an unresolved keyed provider as authenticated.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The request-auth compatibility result is produced by the core model registry before builtin extensions dispatch provider requests.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `ResolvedRequestAuth` type and successful resolution branch in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`.

## 2026-10-01 - Overflow recovery is a two-rung ladder with a fresh budget per turn (senpi#2480, oh-my-openagent#8411)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_overflowRecoveryAttempted` (a boolean latch) is `_overflowRecoveryRungs`, counted against `OVERFLOW_RECOVERY_RUNGS = 2`. `_checkCompaction` runs the first rung with the configured `keepRecentTokens` and the second with `keepRecentTokensOverride: 0` (summary plus the turn being answered), through `_runPrePromptCompaction` on the inline path and a new `options.keepRecentTokensOverride` on `_runAutoCompaction` (applied to both `prepareCompaction` and the execution request). The terminal message is `Context overflow recovery failed after two compact-and-retry attempts. ...`. Every reset site that cleared the boolean now zeroes the counter.
- `_checkCompaction` zeroes the counter when `inlineReason === "pre_prompt"`, before the exhaustion check: a new turn admission (a user prompt or an extension-triggered turn such as a goal continuation) is a fresh overflow episode.
- `_runAutoCompaction`'s retry continuation strips every trailing failed assistant from the rebuilt context (`_stripTrailingFailedAssistants`), not only the last one: after the second rung the kept tail still ends with both rejected attempts of the turn, and continuing from an assistant throws `Cannot continue from message role: assistant`.
- The keep-budget change the second rung depends on is recorded in `compaction/changes.md` (2026-10-01).

### Why

- One compact-and-retry was not enough on the `anthropic-subscription` lane: a re-send that is still too long after the configured tail was kept needs a smaller re-send, not the same one, and the turn died instead ("Context overflow recovery failed after one compact-and-retry attempt", then "Goal continuation blocked").
- The latch was reset by a user `message_start` or a successful assistant, but the pre-prompt gate ran before either, so a spent latch could make later prompts throw the same error with no compaction (`action: "none"`, `tokensBefore == tokensAfter`): "Send any message to resume" was false and a model switch did not clear it (oh-my-openagent#8411). senpi PR #1780 proposed the reset alone; this entry folds it in with the ladder.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The overflow budget, the retry continuation and the pre-prompt admission gate are `AgentSession` internals; extensions only see `session_before_compact`, after the budget decision was made.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: the overflow branch of `_checkCompaction` (the latch block and the compaction call), the `_runAutoCompaction` signature and its `prepareCompaction` call; LOW: the counter resets scattered through `_processAgentEvent`, `_runPrePromptCompaction` and `_runAutoCompaction`.

## 2026-09-30 - Ultrafast reaches only OpenAI and ChatGPT Subscription (senpi#2410)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/ultrafast-lanes.ts` (fork-only): `serviceTierForProvider` drops an `ultrafast` tier for any provider other than `openai` and `chatgpt-subscription`; `ultrafastSelectionWarning` (moved here from `model-resolver.ts`) also warns for those providers.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: the stream function passes every request tier through `serviceTierForProvider`, and always sets `serviceTier` so a dropped tier cannot survive through the spread caller options.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/service-tier.ts`: the resolved tier is checked again at the payload boundary, where disallowed providers have even a pre-populated `service_tier` removed and settings/models.json selections receive the same advisory as decorators.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: imports the warning instead of defining it.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: gateways and other providers that serve an OpenAI model on the Responses API (for example `github-copilot` or `opencode` `gpt-6-astra`) received `service_tier: "ultrafast"`. codex only sends a tier the model's backend catalog lists, and oh-my-pi sends Ultrafast only to first-party OpenAI and Codex models; senpi now matches both.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: SDK sessions without builtin extensions compose the request tier here; the service-tier builtin's payload hook applies the same gate for extension sessions.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: the selection warning is produced during model pattern parsing, before any extension runs.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: the `serviceTier` line in the `streamFn` passed to `new Agent`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: the import block and the Ultrafast advisory helpers above `parseModelPattern`.

## 2026-09-29 - Carry model tier decorators into session startup (senpi#2399)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: accept and forward an explicit initial service tier from the CLI to AgentSession, ahead of scoped/catalog defaults.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the real CLI discarded the parsed tier even though model resolution preserved it, so an Astra Ultrafast command silently ran without that tier.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: this host startup boundary discarded the selection before extension contexts were created.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: initial session options and construction/forwarding calls.

## 2026-09-29 - Explicit Astra Ultrafast request tier (senpi#2399)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config-schema.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: accept `ultrafast` in models.json and either order of effort/tier decorators.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-shapes.ts`: carry and validate the new tier through provider configuration, settings, and auth resolution.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: keep an explicit Ultrafast tier above the session Priority flag in both state and request composition.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config-schema.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: users need explicit Ultrafast model selection without losing an Astra effort.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-shapes.ts`: the selected request tier must survive the full configuration path.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: remembered or stale Fast mode must not downgrade an Ultrafast selection.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config-schema.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: schema validation and model matching run before extension request hooks.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-shapes.ts`: extensions cannot widen these typed and validated host configuration boundaries.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: SDK sessions without builtin extensions also use this effective-tier accessor.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config-schema.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: model serviceTier schema and SERVICE_TIER_VALUES.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-shapes.ts`: service-tier unions and MODEL_SERVICE_TIER_VALUES.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: isFastModeActive and effectiveServiceTier.

## 2026-10-01 - Admitted deliveries emit their own turn trigger (senpi#2424)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `sendCustomMessage(..., { triggerTurn: true })` emits `before_agent_start.trigger: "delivery"` only when `deliveryIdOf` recognises a valid `session_control_delivery`; every other custom-message turn still emits `"extension"`.

### Why

- The first gateway request must receive first-request behavior without making onboarding and other hidden extension turns look user-authored.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `AgentSession` owns the custom-message turn boundary and is the only layer that sees the admitted message's `customType` before emitting `before_agent_start`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts`: the `emitBeforeAgentStart` call in the `sendCustomMessage` trigger-turn path.

## 2026-09-30 - Terminal setting maxDurableMonitors (senpi#2420)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/terminal-settings.ts`: `TerminalSettings` gains `maxDurableMonitors?: number | "unlimited"` (default `"unlimited"`), the optional per-session cap on persistent monitors that the terminal extension resolves and enforces (see `extensions/builtin/terminal/changes.md`).

### Why

Persistent monitors had a fixed cap of 5; the cap is now off by default and this setting brings one back for anyone who wants it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

`TerminalSettings` is the core settings type every `terminal.*` key is declared on.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/terminal-settings.ts`: the persistent-terminal block of `TerminalSettings`.

## 2026-09-30 - Upstream sync repair: actionable boundaries against the fork session core

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: a `turn_end` boundary that commits entries (a retain-none handoff compaction, context edits, custom messages) marks its turn, and the next request's `prepareNextTurnWithContext` re-reads agent state instead of the loop's pre-commit turn context, so the handoff reaches the provider.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: when `agent_before_settle` handlers exist, `_handleAgentEvent` suppresses agent-core's post-run queue drain synchronously at `agent_end` (like required compaction and retry ownership). Input a handler queues then waits for the boundary: an explicit continuation runs first and queued follow-ups wait until it would stop, and input the boundary cannot run stays held instead of starting an untracked run that never settled.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/assistant-usage-scope.ts` (fork-only): provider usage recorded before a boundary `context_edit` no longer counts as current context. `_checkCompaction` resolves the assistant's usage scope against the projection (`resolveAssistantUsageScope`: projected, usage still matching the projection, explicit-overflow retention) before treating usage as overflow evidence or threshold tokens, and `getContextUsage()` estimates from the projection (`estimateProjectedContextTokens`) once the branch carries a `context_edit`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the pre-admission (`threshold`) compaction check no longer treats the previous response's `length` stop as a truncated final attempt to retry; its truncated tool calls already failed and the natural next request carries those results.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/assistant-usage-scope.ts`: assistant usage scope builds a session projection only when a later context edit or compaction can change the answer, preserving virtual selections without per-request projection.

### Why

The upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6) actionable boundaries (`finishTurn`/`turn_end` D-16, `agent_before_settle` D-15, `context_edit` projection D-27) commit through the fork session core, which kept its own next-turn context, post-run queue drain, usage accounting and length recovery; each point read state that the boundary had already changed.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The boundary commit, the next-request context, the post-run queue owner and compaction accounting are all owned by `AgentSession`; extensions only return drafts.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `_dispatchTurnEndBoundary`, the `messages` choice in `_installAgentNextTurnRefresh`, the `agent_end` branch of `_handleAgentEvent`, the overflow/threshold head of `_checkCompaction`, and the estimate in `getContextUsage()`.

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): compaction admission and overflow recovery measure a virtual selection by its limits model

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the threshold check at the end of `_enforceCompactionBeforeProvider` and the oversize check of `_enforceFinalProviderAdmission` read the window of `_limitsModel()` instead of `this.model`. Under a virtual selection that is the physical model of the latest response, before one the virtual model's declared window; a virtual model without declared limits (`contextWindow` 0) is not checked, because its limits are unknown until a request is routed. The recoverable-length test in `_checkCompaction` reads the output limit of the model that produced the message (`limitsModel`, already used there for the window) instead of `this.model.maxTokens`. Physical selections are unchanged (both resolve to `this.model` for them).

### Why

The fork admission compared the transcript against the virtual catalog entry. A virtual model with no declared window has `contextWindow` 0, so `shouldCompact` and the final admission were always oversized and the first prompt under such a selection failed with `RequiredCompactionError` before anything could be routed (`test/virtual-models.test.ts` tree-navigation resume case); one with a declared window was compacted against that window even after a larger physical model answered, contrary to the adopted virtual-model contract (`docs/virtual-models.md`: context usage and compaction use the limits of the physical model that produced the latest response). A virtual model declares no `maxTokens`, so a truncated (`length`) response under a virtual selection was never recognized as recoverable and was not compacted and retried (`test/suite/virtual-models.test.ts` "routes the compact-and-retry after a truncated response as a retry"); upstream reads the producing model's `maxTokens` there.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Pre-provider compaction admission and overflow recovery are the core session's gates around every provider request; an extension cannot change which model's limits they read.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The final `shouldCompact` guard of `_enforceCompactionBeforeProvider`, the model/reserve lines at the top of `_enforceFinalProviderAdmission`, and the `recoverableLength` line of `_checkCompaction` in `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): compaction summaries use the routed thinking level

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_getCompactionRequestAuth` returns the thinking level resolved by `_getSummarizationRequestAuth`, and `_runDefaultCompaction` takes it as a parameter and passes it to `compact()` instead of `this.thinkingLevel`. Under a virtual selection that is the level the router chose for the `direct` request; otherwise it is still the session level.

### Why

The fork already routed a virtual selection before sizing the summary (adopted upstream `_getSummarizationRequestAuth`), but dropped the routed level and summarized with the session's own level, so the router's choice for summaries was ignored (`test/suite/virtual-models.test.ts` "routes compaction summaries before sizing them"). Upstream passes `request.thinkingLevel` to `compact()`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The default compaction summary request is assembled inside the core session; an extension can replace the whole summary but cannot change the level of the built-in one.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The return type of `_getCompactionRequestAuth`, the parameter list and `compact()` call of `_runDefaultCompaction`, and its caller in the auto/manual compaction path of `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): a failed routing response does not restore as the session model

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: the session-context model derivation skips assistant messages of a virtual model (`isVirtualModel`, api `pi-virtual`). Such a message is the error response of a failed routing attempt; no model answered it. Resuming a transcript that ends with one now restores the physical model that answered last instead of failing to restore the virtual id and falling back to the first available model.

### Why

The fork restores physical selections from the session context (fallback windows, explicit selections, legacy provider ids), while upstream reads them from `getBranchSelection()`, which already skips virtual responses. Without the skip, `createAgentSession` resumed the wrong model and reported a fallback (`test/virtual-models.test.ts` "falls back to the last physical response when the transcript ends with a routing failure").

### Why an extension could not handle it

Session restore runs in the core session manager before any extension can observe or change the selection.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The assistant-message branch of the session-context settings loop in `session-manager.ts` and one import line.

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): extension loader, runner and wrappers

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/source-info.ts`: Upstream `BUILTIN_PATH_PREFIX`, `getSyntheticPathSource()`, `isSyntheticPath()` adopted beside the fork `system` scope; consumed by `loader.ts`.

### Why

Upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6) changed these paths while the fork carries its own behavior; the extension loader/runner/wrapper adopt upstream contracts additively and keep the fork builtins, signatures and loader alias table (plan D-2).

### Why an extension could not handle it

This is the extension host itself; extensions cannot redefine how they are loaded, wrapped or dispatched.

### Expected merge conflict zones

Every path listed above conflicts again where upstream edits the hunks named in its line; the fork-kept constructs named there are the anchors to preserve.

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): settings, entrypoints and resource loading

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts`: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts`: import union (`BUILTIN_PATH_PREFIX` + `SourceScope`, fork skill-discovery); upstream `builtin:<name>` resolution and #9863 git-dependency install args (auto-merged) accepted.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: adopted upstream `builtin:<name>` extension paths (`isBuiltinExtension`, `builtinExtensions` map fed to `DefaultPackageManager({ builtinExtensions })`, built-in paths deferred to the final pass, `loadExtensionPaths`), replaceable-extension omission with warnings (`omitReplacedExtensions`), host-dependency package warnings (#9863, `collectExtensionPackageWarnings`, `LoadExtensionsResult.warnings`), synthetic-path source info (`getSyntheticPathSource`, `isSyntheticPath`), prompt-template diagnostics, terminal color mode for theme loading. `builtin:<name>` resolves first against caller-supplied built-in inline extensions, then against the FORK builtin registry (`extensions/builtin/index.ts`): `-e builtin:<id>` loads a registry builtin the settings disabled; an already-active registry builtin is a no-op; unknown names report `Unknown built-in extension`. Nothing is wired to upstream `src/extensions/{codemode,mcp,tool-search}`. Fork kept: `loadExtensions(..., buildGlobalDefaultExtensionLoadOptions())` (global-default shim resolver) on every path including builtin/file loads, per-session `extensionSession` profile, factory/bundled/inline extensions ordered ahead of file extensions, `rebuildExtensionFlagDefaults`, eventBus carry-over, mcpRegistry override, package-identity dedupe and vendored-builtin shadowing (both now skip synthetic `builtin:` paths so they are never deduped/shadowed as files). Replacement warning says `${APP_NAME} config`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: adopted upstream `+name`/`-name` `defaultTools` (`mergeDefaultTools` in `deepMergeSettings`, `resolveDefaultTools` in `getDefaultTools`) with `DEFAULT_TOOL_NAMES` = the fork default `read, bash, edit, write, grep`; fork `retry.fallbackChains` replace-on-override kept in the same merge. Adopted `getSettings()` (C-EX-12), `deviceId` + `getOrCreateDeviceId()` (vendored inert, D-4), `fullscreenWheelScrollLines` + getter/setter (`WheelScrollLines` from pi-tui). Kept every fork getter (session_shutdown budgets, provider-id migration, recommended/favorite models, ask-user timeout). DROPPED: `cacheWarming`, `CACHE_WARMING_MODES`, `CacheWarmingMode`, `get/setCacheWarmingMode` (D-5); upstream `codemode` / `CodemodeSettings` / `CodemodeMode` (D-2: only the excluded upstream codemode extension read them). Theme default "system" is not a settings-manager concern (getTheme() returns undefined when unset); it lives in theme.ts / startup-ui.ts.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts`: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts`: upstream `/bug` entry removed (D-6).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts`: Silent rows read and accepted as merged: `cli/startup-ui.ts` (system theme startup, D-14), `core/keybindings.ts` (descriptions), `core/prompt-templates.ts` (diagnostics result), `core/trust-manager.ts` (adds `mcp.json`; the fork MCP reads project `.senpi/mcp.json`; the `.pi` legacy-trust fix is untouched), `experimental/process.ts` (`--import` URL), `package-manager-cli.ts` (builtin names into config), tests `args`, `package-manager`, `stdout-cleanliness`, `5943-session-start-notify`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/prompt-templates.ts`: Silent rows read and accepted as merged: `cli/startup-ui.ts` (system theme startup, D-14), `core/keybindings.ts` (descriptions), `core/prompt-templates.ts` (diagnostics result), `core/trust-manager.ts` (adds `mcp.json`; the fork MCP reads project `.senpi/mcp.json`; the `.pi` legacy-trust fix is untouched), `experimental/process.ts` (`--import` URL), `package-manager-cli.ts` (builtin names into config), tests `args`, `package-manager`, `stdout-cleanliness`, `5943-session-start-notify`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/trust-manager.ts`: Silent rows read and accepted as merged: `cli/startup-ui.ts` (system theme startup, D-14), `core/keybindings.ts` (descriptions), `core/prompt-templates.ts` (diagnostics result), `core/trust-manager.ts` (adds `mcp.json`; the fork MCP reads project `.senpi/mcp.json`; the `.pi` legacy-trust fix is untouched), `experimental/process.ts` (`--import` URL), `package-manager-cli.ts` (builtin names into config), tests `args`, `package-manager`, `stdout-cleanliness`, `5943-session-start-notify`.

### Why

Upstream v0.99.1 settings/resource-loading features are adopted where they carry no excluded subsystem; D-2/D-5/D-6 exclusions remove codemode, MCP, tool-search, cache-warming and /bug surfaces; fork runtime contracts (tool defaults, loader ordering, global-default shims, session profiles) win on conflict.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Settings layering, resource/extension resolution, the package barrel and CLI entrypoints are core loader/bootstrap code that runs before any extension loads.

### Expected merge conflict zones

`settings-manager.ts` Settings interface + deepMergeSettings + getDefaultTools; `resource-loader.ts` constructor, loadCurrentExtensionSet, loadExtensionPaths, loadFinalExtensionSet; `index.ts` extension type export block; `main.ts` createCliRuntimeFactory diagnostics; upstream re-adding cacheWarming/codemode/mcp settings or exports.

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): model layer

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`: `model-registry.ts`: `AuthStorage`-backed constructor, `create`/`inMemory`, fallback availability, `extraBody`/`upstreamModelId`/`serviceTier` in `ResolvedRequestAuth`, `BUILT_IN_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAMES`, `isFallbackEligible`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: `model-resolver.ts`: `meta: "muse-spark-1.3"` default (auto-merged); upstream xai/fireworks/together defaults already matched the fork. `model-resolver.ts`: `defaultModelPerProvider: Record<string, string>` with the fork providers (`alibaba-token-plan`, `anthropic-subscription`, `chatgpt-subscription`, `ollama`, `cursor`, `opengateway`, `venice`, GPT-6.1 Sol defaults); no `openai-codex` default.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: `model-runtime.ts`: credential-pool rotation (`couldRotateCredentials`, `credentialRotationSources`, `streamWithCredentialRotation`, affinity key), #2297 rejected-token recovery (`attemptWithTokenRecovery`, `rejectableAccess`, `rejectedTokenStatuses`), per-provider semaphores, `withPayloadRequestMetadata`, `prepareSimpleRequest` (#2096 prewarm), compatibility `extraBody`/`upstreamModelId`/`serviceTier` request shaping, `normalizeProviderId` read boundary and disabled-provider deletion in `recomposeProvider` (senpi#1989), `setWireIdentity(BRAND?.userAgent ?? APP_NAME)`, `installClaudeCodeVersionFileStore`, `remoteCatalogServesProvider` gating, Kimi text-tool-call recovery (`wrapStreamWithModelRecovery`, now fed `getCurrentTools(transcript.messages)`).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`: `provider-composer.ts`: `ProviderModelConfig` split (chat/image/classifier), `ProviderConfigInput.images/classifiers`, `getAllModels`/`filterAllModels` on composed providers, `extensionModelFromDefinition`/`findExtensionModelDefaults`, typed `findModelDefaults` (chat subset), `mergeInputLimits`, `inputLimits`/`promptCache` in `applyModelOverride`/`modelFromJson`, image/classifier dispatch to extension or base implementations, `rawModelHeaders` matched by operation + id. `provider-composer.ts`: the `findModelDefaults` inherit fix (an existing catalog entry is the defaults source for a same-id models.json definition; extension `api`/`baseUrl` retarget it), models.json custom models surviving an extension model list (`customModelIds`), whitelist/blacklist, the local-Ollama catalog rule, `extraBody`/`upstreamModelId`/`serviceTier`/`promptPreset`/`recoverTextToolCalls`/`cacheRetention`/`defaultThinkingLevel`/`thinkingLevelMapMode`, video input, `retryPolicy`, `fallbackEligible`, `ExtensionOAuthConfig.check/resolveAmbient`, async `!command` header resolution, the text-protocol tool-call middleware (tools now read from the transcript), the detailed "No API provider registered" message, and the fork wording "Set at provider or model level." for chat definitions (pinned by `provider-composer-extension-models-json.test.ts`).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-provider.ts`: `remote-catalog-provider.ts`: `?types=chat,image,classifier`, image/classifier overlays via `getAllModels`, unknown model types dropped, type-aware id merge for non-chat rows. `remote-catalog-provider.ts`: `FORK_ONLY_BUILTIN_PROVIDERS`, `remoteCatalogServesProvider`, capability-conflict rejection for chat rows (`mergeRemoteCatalogModels`, `getRemoteCatalogConflicts`), strict chat-row validation (`parseRemoteCatalog`).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-prompt.ts`: `system-prompt.ts`: `NormalizedBuildSystemPromptOptions`, `normalizeBuildSystemPromptOptions`, `SystemPromptSections`, `buildSystemPromptSections`, `buildSystemPromptState`, `diffSystemPromptSections`, option fields `forceSystemPrompt`, `toolGuidelines`, `sections`; pi docs guidance lists `MCP servers (docs/mcp.md)`. `system-prompt.ts`: `buildSystemPrompt()` keeps the fork string layout ("Available tools:", "Guidelines:", trailing "Current working directory:"), the eval-only grep guideline (`getEvalOnlyGrepGuideline`, also applied in the section rules) and the `surface` option (carried by `normalizeBuildSystemPromptOptions`).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts`: `core/model-config.ts`: auto-merge accepted as-is; every upstream hunk landed inside the fork's commented-out legacy schema blocks (the file validates through `model-config-schema.ts`), so the upstream schema additions were ported into `model-config-schema.ts` instead.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/usage-totals.ts`: Silent `usage-totals.ts`: `combineUsage()` and session `usage` entries in the cost breakdown, next to the fork prompt-cache prewarm bucket. `core/usage-totals.ts`: auto-merge accepted (upstream `combineUsage` + `usage` entry branch beside the fork prewarm bucket; `UsageEntry` exists in the scaffold `session-manager.ts`, L3a scope).

### Why

Upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6) changed these paths while the fork carries its own behavior; the model layer adds upstream virtual models and image/classifier rows while keeping the fork system-prompt layout and chat-only request shaping (plan D-15).

### Why an extension could not handle it

Model registry/resolver/runtime compose providers before extensions see a model.

### Expected merge conflict zones

Every path listed above conflicts again where upstream edits the hunks named in its line; the fork-kept constructs named there are the anchors to preserve.

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): session core

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`: services: extension virtual models queued during loading are registered after the fork provider replay (errors become diagnostics), before the fork scoped refresh. messages: `system` messages pass through `convertToLlm` like user/assistant/toolResult; fork `configurationUpdate` kept. runtime (silent, accepted): session replacement setup calls `session.refreshContext()`; fork-at-leaf error text says "Send a message before cloning or forking it." (matches #10000).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: What changed (upstream adopted): the agent `finishTurn` hook is consumed (`_installAgentBoundaryHooks`): `turn_end` extension boundaries (`runner.emitBoundary`, `TurnEndEvent` with `messageEntryId`/`toolResultEntryIds`/`outcome`, boundary entry drafts custom/custom_message/context_edit/compaction committed through the session manager) run before the agent emits `turn_end`, and a boundary `continue` returns `{ action: "continue" }`; the `turn_end` agent event only dispatches the boundary for messages `finishTurn` did not already handle. Because the fork persists `message_end` on its non-awaited event queue, `finishTurn` first awaits the queued persistence of the turn's assistant message and tool results (a per-message settled promise) so the boundary always resolves `messageEntryId`, including on a text-only final turn. That await lets the retry handler drop the failed assistant before the core's post-run queue check, so `_handleAgentEvent` now suppresses the core queue drain synchronously at `agent_end` whenever `_willRetryAfterAgentEnd` holds (as it already did for required compaction): queued steering stays with the retry owner instead of joining the doomed retry request. A user abort during a failed attempt reports `agent_end.willRetry: false` (`_willRetryAfterAgentEnd` returns false while `_suppressQueuedContinuationAfterUserAbort` is set) and ends the pending retry with `auto_retry_end` `finalError: "Retry cancelled"`, the same as an abort during backoff (#9340; upstream `_finishCancelledRetry` not adopted). Auto-compaction (#9777): `_runAutoCompaction` passes the controller signal to its pre-admission `getAuth` so `abort()`/`abortCompaction()` cancel a pending auth, ends an aborted-but-still-owned operation (including an abort from a synchronous `compaction_start` listener) with `compaction_end` `aborted: true`, and reports an auth failure as `Auto-compaction failed: <error>` (aborted only when its own controller aborted) instead of a silent non-error end. `compaction_start` stays after auth and preparation (upstream emits it before auth): an auto attempt superseded while its auth is pending owns no public events (fork `compaction-race` contract). `agent_before_settle` runs where the fork run would otherwise settle (agent_end, no launched continuation, no user abort / blocked retry); a `continue` (or input queued by its handlers) schedules one more continuation, held input stays held. `prepareRequest` is installed (`_installAgentRequestProjection`) for virtual models (D-15): the selection stays in agent state, each request of a virtual selection is routed through `ModelRuntime.resolveModel` (reason user/continuation/retry, the failed response of an auto-retry or overflow recovery as `failed`, router state stored as a `virtual-model-state` custom entry); `routedModel` getter; `_modelForMessage`/`_limitsModel` supply physical limits for overflow checks, retryable-error classification, context usage and tool-result image resize; summaries (compaction, branch summary, title) route a virtual selection first (`_getSummarizationRequestAuth(model, signal)` returns `thinkingLevel`, auth lookups carry the abort signal); the selection is recorded on the branch at run start (`_recordSelection`). Nested tool calls (`ctx.executeTool()` -> `_executeNestedToolCall` through `NestedToolCallRunner` + agent-core `runToolCall`, `getCallableTools`; results carry `nestedCalls` and combined usage; `parentToolCallId` on `tool_call`/`tool_result` hooks); `structuredContent` kept through `tool_result` hooks; `ToolInfo.namespace/annotations`; exposure `model-only`/`hidden` honored (hidden never activates or declares; model-only declared, not callable from other tools; `defaultActive: false` skips activation on registration); built-in tool source paths are `builtin:<name>` (D-2); virtual model register/unregister runtime actions; `steer()`/`followUp()` return `QueuedInputDisposition` ("handled" | "queued") and `PromptDisposition = QueuedInputDisposition | "started"` is exported (C-RPC-1); `refreshContext()`/`_refreshFinalizedContext()` rebuild agent messages from the session (fork restore keeps messages awaiting persistence) and map projected messages to their entry ids; `usage` entries count in session stats; the unrelated local retry closure formerly named `finishTurn` is now `finishRetryAttempt`. Fork behavior preserved: the whole fork write path and admission protocol (`compactBeforeNextAdmission`, `_enforceCompactionBeforeProvider`, `_enforceFinalProviderAdmission`, idle/drain protocol and `_emitAgentIdleAfterDeferredTurns`, `_agentSettledDelivery`, `_activeCompactionLogAttempt`, session-control endpoint, host handoff, credential accounts, pathless reservation callers, external admission), `setModel` persist-by-default, the fork `prompt()`/`_prompt()` pipeline byte-for-byte (manual continue, input dispositions, queue-while-streaming/auto-compaction, unknown commands, title generation), fork `before_agent_start` shape and string system prompt (`systemPrompt` getter reads agent state; `_rebuildSystemPrompt` fork layout, C-EX-9/C-AG-4), fork retry/fallback controller and overflow recovery that removes the failed message from agent state, fork compaction (`_runDefaultCompaction` with extraBody/transformContext and cache-friendly source contexts), bash messages pushed into agent state, fork tool registry (eval-only policy, lazy activators, allowed-tools declarations). Excluded (D-5, D-2, Exclusion list): cache warming (no `CacheWarmer` config/field, `cacheWarmingStatus`, `setCacheWarmingMode`, `onAgentSettled`/`onWarmed` wiring); bug reporting (`summarizeForBugReport`, `generateBugReportSummary` import); upstream prompt image normalization in `prompt()` (fork CLI-side resize kept, L7a decision); upstream transcript-carried system prompt/tool loadout (`_preparePromptAndToolLoadout`, `_applyToolLoadout`, `prepareLoadout` declarations, forced-prompt and hidden-declaration projections, `_restoreToolsFromTranscript`) - C-EX-2 says prepareLoadout is wired only if L3a lands `_preparePromptAndToolLoadout`, and it does not (fork shorthand, L1 decision); upstream persistent context-edit omission of recovery attempts (`_omitRecoveryAttempt`); upstream `_runAgentPrompt` loop and `_isEmittingAgentSettled` deferral. Why: upstream v0.99.1 boundary events, virtual models, nested tool calls and per-input disposition need the session to consume `finishTurn`/`prepareRequest`; the fork session semantics are pinned by fork tests and consumed by omo. Why an extension could not handle it: AgentSession owns the loop hooks, persistence and admission every mode drives. Expected merge conflict zones: imports (agent-core/pi-ai/extensions/session-manager/source-info/usage-totals/virtual-models), `AgentSessionEvent` union, `PromptDisposition`/`QueuedInputDisposition`, private fields block, constructor installs, auth helpers `_getRequiredRequestAuth`/`_getSummarizationRequestAuth`, tool hooks (`preflightToolCall`, `_emitAfterToolCallHooks`), `_installAgentNextTurnRefresh`, boundary helpers after the Event Subscription header, `_handleAgentEvent`/`_processAgentEvent` agent_end tail, `setActiveToolsByName`, `_queueUserInput`/`steer`/`followUp`, `_checkCompaction` overflow source, `_runAutoCompaction` start/auth ordering, `_willRetryAfterAgentEnd`, `_refreshToolRegistry` activation predicate, extension context actions. `packages/coding-agent/src/core/index.ts`, `core/radius.ts`, `test/radius.test.ts` stay deleted (git rm, D rows). Upstream-only importers of `core/radius.ts` are all excluded or foreign: `core/bug-report-upload.ts`, `modes/interactive/bug-report.ts` (Exclusion list) and `experimental/radius-auth.ts` (THEIRS-modified shared file; OURS form imports no `core/radius.ts` - flagged for its owner at the join). The `src/index.ts` barrel (L7a) is untouched; every export it takes from `core/agent-session.ts`, `core/messages.ts`, `core/sdk.ts`, `core/session-manager.ts` resolves (scratch probe tsc: no TS2305 on those modules).

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: What changed: `provider_stream_event` dispatch (`onProviderStreamEvent` on the Agent -> `runner.emit({ type: "provider_stream_event", data, provider, api, model })`, #9784/D-15); a virtual selection recorded by `model_change` entries is restored on resume (`getBranchSelection`), every physical selection keeps the fork session-context restore rules; default tool names come from `DEFAULT_TOOL_NAMES` (L7a keeps the fork value read/bash/edit/write/grep). Orchestrator finding (1): the scaffold's auto-merged `import { CacheWarmer } from "./cache-warmer.ts"`, the `new CacheWarmer(...)` construction, `cacheWarmer.start(...)` in the stream function, the `cacheWarmer` session config field and upstream `buildRequestOptions`/`cacheContextIsCurrent` are removed (D-5); `grep -n "CacheWarmer\|cacheWarm\|cache-warmer" sdk.ts` is empty; the fork's `builtin/cache-keepalive` stays the only mechanism. Fork preserved: stream function with provider retry profiles, service-tier resolution, `isActive` runner guards, `onPayload` request forwarding, Cursor exec bridge, message restore on the Agent after construction, startup model-usability admission and resume slice. Expected merge conflict zones: pi-ai imports, session model restore, the request-option block before `new Agent`, the Agent options, `new AgentSession` config. `packages/coding-agent/src/core/index.ts`, `core/radius.ts`, `test/radius.test.ts` stay deleted (git rm, D rows). Upstream-only importers of `core/radius.ts` are all excluded or foreign: `core/bug-report-upload.ts`, `modes/interactive/bug-report.ts` (Exclusion list) and `experimental/radius-auth.ts` (THEIRS-modified shared file; OURS form imports no `core/radius.ts` - flagged for its owner at the join). The `src/index.ts` barrel (L7a) is untouched; every export it takes from `core/agent-session.ts`, `core/messages.ts`, `core/sdk.ts`, `core/session-manager.ts` resolves (scratch probe tsc: no TS2305 on those modules).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: Adopted: `ContextEditEntry` + `appendContextEdit`, `ProjectedSessionEntry`/`SessionProjection` + `buildSessionProjection` (the fork `buildSessionContext` is now the projection's messages with the fork settings, both fed by `_getCompactEntries()`; edited copies keep their entry identity), compaction entries store the current system message (`systemMessage`) and project `[systemMessage, summary]`, retain-none `appendCompaction(summary, null, ...)`, `UsageEntry` + `appendUsage` (usage-only entries, counted by stats; the cache-warming writer itself is excluded), `findById`, recent-session discovery that stops at the first matching header, `list(cwd, dir, onProgress, signal)` / `listAll(..., signal)` with `SessionListProgress(loaded, total, partialSessions?)` threaded through `session-discovery.ts` with the summary index as the data source (first row, then every 10 rows per directory / 100 rows across directories; an aborted signal rejects), #10000 (a new session file is written at the first user OR assistant message, `_hasConversation()`/`isConversationEntry`, also used by `createBranchedSession`), footer-cheap `getSessionName` stays the fork cache. Fork preserved: write-before-commit `_persist` + `_appendEntry`, every `reserveSessionWrite` call (9 hits), `_writeHeaderAsync`/`persistHeaderNow` (NOT gated by the conversation rule - see decisions), `discardFailedFirstFlush(Async)`, torn-tail guard, resident store materialization, atomic rewrite, caller-chosen id rewrite, `discardHeaderOnlyFile`, index-backed listing, `getEntryCount()` from the maintained counter (the auto-merged upstream `byId.size` duplicate removed). Expected merge conflict zones: pi-ai import block, FileEntry union, readonly method list, compaction message projection, `buildSessionContext`, listing helpers, `_persist` first-flush gate, `buildSessionContext` method, `listAll` body. `packages/coding-agent/src/core/index.ts`, `core/radius.ts`, `test/radius.test.ts` stay deleted (git rm, D rows). Upstream-only importers of `core/radius.ts` are all excluded or foreign: `core/bug-report-upload.ts`, `modes/interactive/bug-report.ts` (Exclusion list) and `experimental/radius-auth.ts` (THEIRS-modified shared file; OURS form imports no `core/radius.ts` - flagged for its owner at the join). The `src/index.ts` barrel (L7a) is untouched; every export it takes from `core/agent-session.ts`, `core/messages.ts`, `core/sdk.ts`, `core/session-manager.ts` resolves (scratch probe tsc: no TS2305 on those modules). The `ModelChangeRejectedEntry` durability doc follows #10000: a refusal recorded before the first user or assistant message reaches the JSONL when that message flushes the buffer.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`: services: extension virtual models queued during loading are registered after the fork provider replay (errors become diagnostics), before the fork scoped refresh. messages: `system` messages pass through `convertToLlm` like user/assistant/toolResult; fork `configurationUpdate` kept. runtime (silent, accepted): session replacement setup calls `session.refreshContext()`; fork-at-leaf error text says "Send a message before cloning or forking it." (matches #10000).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/prompt-cache-prefix-request.ts` (fork-only): agent-core `buildProviderContext` now returns a `TranscriptContext` (prompt and tools folded into the leading system message, A2 C-AG-3), which is structurally assignable to `Context`, so the prefix request silently carried no `systemPrompt`/`tools` and a system message in `messages`; the session-start prewarm and the cache keep-alive ping then no longer matched the turn (senpi#2096, #2389). The builder still goes through `buildProviderContext` (same declared list and `activeToolNames` as the loop) and replays the result back into the `Context` shape `PromptCachePrefixRequest.context` declares: `systemPrompt`/`tools` from the replayed system message, `messages` without system messages.

### Why

Upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6) changed these paths while the fork carries its own behavior; the session core keeps the fork write path and prompt pipeline and adopts the upstream projection, context edits and finishTurn boundary hooks (plan D-27, D-16, D-5).

### Why an extension could not handle it

AgentSession and SessionManager own persistence and the turn lifecycle that extensions observe.

### Expected merge conflict zones

Every path listed above conflicts again where upstream edits the hunks named in its line; the fork-kept constructs named there are the anchors to preserve.

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): interactive mode and theme

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/export-html/template.css`: Silent rows read and accepted: export-html `template.css`/`template.js` (nested call records, toggle state), `extension-selector.ts` (description), `session-selector.ts` (progress/abort), `tree-selector.ts` (usage entries hidden, context_edit rows), `theme-json.ts` (`appearance`, compiled validator kept), `theme-schema.json`; tests `interactive-mode-compaction` (#9340), `interactive-tui` (wheel lines, file-path mock), `session-selector-path-delete`, `settings-selector` (system theme, wheel cycle), `streaming-render-debug.ts`, `tree-selector`, `utilities.ts`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/export-html/template.js`: Silent rows read and accepted: export-html `template.css`/`template.js` (nested call records, toggle state), `extension-selector.ts` (description), `session-selector.ts` (progress/abort), `tree-selector.ts` (usage entries hidden, context_edit rows), `theme-json.ts` (`appearance`, compiled validator kept), `theme-schema.json`; tests `interactive-mode-compaction` (#9340), `interactive-tui` (wheel lines, file-path mock), `session-selector-path-delete`, `settings-selector` (system theme, wheel cycle), `streaming-render-debug.ts`, `tree-selector`, `utilities.ts`.

### Why

Upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6) changed these paths while the fork carries its own behavior; interactive mode adopts the upstream system theme, virtual-model footer and args display while keeping fork chrome; no /bug (plan D-14, D-6).

### Why an extension could not handle it

Interactive mode is the host UI that renders extensions.

### Expected merge conflict zones

Every path listed above conflicts again where upstream edits the hunks named in its line; the fork-kept constructs named there are the anchors to preserve.

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): upstream features excluded on record

### What changed

Upstream paths below are not added (or stay deleted) in this sync; `.github/agent/upstream-exclusions.txt` lists them for mechanical re-exclusion after every upstream merge.

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/bug-report-upload.ts` (not added / kept deleted)
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/bug-report.ts` (not added / kept deleted)
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cache-warmer.ts` (not added / kept deleted)
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/mcp-servers.ts` (not added / kept deleted)

### Why

The fork keeps one implementation per capability: its own builtin mcp, tool-search and senpi-codemode instead of upstream's codemode/MCP/tool-search built-ins and packages (plan D-2, owner default Q1); builtin cache-keepalive instead of upstream cache warming, whose default spends paid refreshes (D-5, Q3); report-bug skills instead of `/bug` uploads to Radius (D-6, Q4); no `packages/durable`, which nothing in the fork imports (D-7). Paths the fork had already deleted (core/index.ts, core/radius.ts, session-share.ts, tui latex.ts, providers/openai-codex.ts, npm-shrinkwrap.json) stay deleted.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Exclusion is a repository-level decision about which upstream files exist at all; an extension can add behavior but cannot remove files an upstream merge adds.

### Expected merge conflict zones

Every upstream release that touches these paths re-adds or modifies them: re-run `git rm -rqf --ignore-unmatch $(cat .github/agent/upstream-exclusions.txt)` after the merge and extend the list (with a dated block here) when upstream adds a new file to an excluded feature.
## 2026-09-30 - A usage limit worded as text switches pooled accounts and cools the spent one until its reset (senpi#1768)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/usage-limit.ts` (fork-only, new): `isAccountUsageLimitText(text)` recognises an account usage limit that reaches the pool with no HTTP status: the shared `USAGE_LIMIT_EXHAUSTION` markers (`usage_limit_reached`, `usage_not_included`, "The usage limit has been reached"), "hit/reached your ... limit" (ChatGPT, Claude session/weekly/5-hour), "Monthly usage limit reached", `GoUsageLimitError` / `FreeUsageLimitError`, `blocking_limit`, `rapid_refill_breaker`, "quota exceeded". The "approaching your usage limit" warning does not match.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/reset-time.ts` (fork-only, new): `usageLimitResetMs(text, nowMs)` reads the reset time from a JSON `resets_at` (epoch seconds) or `reset_after_seconds` field, relative prose ("resets in 3 hours", "try again in 2h"), or a clock time ("resets 12am (Asia/Seoul)", "resets Oct 2, 9am", "try again at 12:00 AM"; no zone means local time). Past times give 0; malformed ones give nothing.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/classify.ts`: `classifyCredentialFailure` sends such a limit to the rate-limit failover branch unless the text is overflow prose, and for a usage limit floors the cooldown on the reset time (the error's reset headers, then the text) when the existing retry hint finds none. It takes an optional `nowMs`. `RATE_LIMIT_TEXT` is unchanged from before #1769.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/rotation-stream.ts`: the classifier gets the pool's clock (`nowMs: now()`).

### Why

- A provider that reports a spent subscription only in words classified `fail_request`, so a second logged-in account was never tried and nothing was blocked; the request fell straight to the model fallback chain (senpi#1768).
- A spent account is out until its reset, so a fixed 60 s cooldown sent the next requests back into it; the reset time now sets that account's cooldown, capped at 48 h, and the pool still moves to the next account at once.
- Only the pool's cooldown reads the new reset forms. `extract429RetryAfterMs` in `@earendil-works/pi-ai` is untouched, so model-fallback and same-model retry timing are unchanged (senpi#1771 stays open for that layer).

### Why an extension could not handle it

Credential rotation and its failure classifier are core runtime; no extension hook sees a provider failure before the pool decides.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/classify.ts`: the rate-limit branch condition and its hint expression.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/rotation-stream.ts`: the `classify` wrapper's context.
## 2026-09-30 - Package-manager subprocesses stay hidden on Windows (senpi#2450)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts`: `spawnCommand`, `spawnCaptureCommand` and `runCommandSync` pass `windowsHide: true` to the child-process wrappers; commands, arguments, environment and stdio are unchanged (`test/package-manager.test.ts`).

### Why

Package operations such as extension installs and skill dependency installs could open a visible console window on Windows.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The package manager starts these subprocesses in core before an extension can alter their spawn options.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the spawn option literals in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts` and the `command spawning` tests in `packages/coding-agent/test/package-manager.test.ts`.

## 2026-10-01 - GPT-6 Astra high-reasoning warning shows above high (xhigh and max) (senpi#2496)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/high-reasoning-warning.ts`: the Astra-only `max` threshold is gone; every sensitive model, GPT-6 Astra included, warns at `xhigh` and `max` and stays quiet at `high` and below (`test/high-reasoning-warning.test.ts`, `test/high-reasoning-warning-event.test.ts`, `test/suite/astra-high-reasoning-warning.test.ts`). This reverses the `max`-only rule from `packages/coding-agent/src/changes.md` "2026-09-10 - Restrict GPT-6 Astra high-reasoning warning to max" (#1564).

### Why

The owner wants the Astra warning to appear for any effort above high, so `xhigh` must warn too.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The warning predicate is core session policy evaluated before the warning event is emitted.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/high-reasoning-warning.ts`: fork-only file.

## 2026-09-30 - High-reasoning warning covers Venice's dotless gpt-61-sol (senpi#2390)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/high-reasoning-warning.ts`: the Sol pattern accepts one digit glued to the 6 (`gpt-6(?:\.\d+|\d)?-sol`), so `openai-gpt-61-sol` warns at `xhigh` / `max` like every other GPT-6.1 Sol id; `gpt-61` and `gpt-611-sol` stay out (`test/high-reasoning-warning.test.ts`).

### Why

Venice spells the point release without the dot.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The warning matcher is core.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/high-reasoning-warning.ts`: fork-only file.

## 2026-09-30 - The global extension shim names the install, not a runtime snapshot (#2408)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: `canonicalizeGlobalDefaultExtensionModulePath()` maps a path inside a runtime snapshot to the same path in the install it was taken from (`resolveInstallPath()` from `src/runtime-snapshot/marker.ts`) before resolving symlinks.

### Why

- The snapshot's `dist` used to be links into the install, so resolving symlinks alone reached the install. It is a copy now (#2408), and the shim in the agent directory outlives any one snapshot and is shared by the sessions of every build, so it must keep naming the install.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The shim path is computed by the resource loader before extensions load.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the body of `canonicalizeGlobalDefaultExtensionModulePath()` and the imports of `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`.

## 2026-09-30 - GPT-6.1 Sol becomes the OpenAI provider default; warning covers it (senpi#2390)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: `defaultModelPerProvider.openai` and `defaultModelPerProvider["chatgpt-subscription"]` move from `gpt-6-sol` to `gpt-6.1-sol`. Nothing else in the resolver changes; a registry without the id falls through to first-available as before (`test/provider-default-model-selection.test.ts` keeps a GPT-6-Sol-only and a GPT-5.6-Sol-only case).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/high-reasoning-warning.ts`: `SENSITIVE_MODEL_ID_PATTERN` matches `gpt-6(?:\.\d+)?-sol`, so `gpt-6.1-sol` and its `-fast` / `-pro` / gateway-prefixed forms warn at `xhigh` and `max` like GPT-6 Sol; `gpt-6.1` alone and `gpt-6.1-solaris` stay out.

### Why

OpenAI released GPT-6.1 Sol on 2026-09-29 and openai/codex made it the default catalog model (priority 1) the same day; senpi followed the same pattern when GPT-6 Sol replaced GPT-5.6 Sol. The warning keys on the Sol tier, which now has a point release.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The provider default table is consulted during initial model selection before extensions are bound; the warning matcher is core.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: the `defaultModelPerProvider` table (fork-only entries around `openai` / `chatgpt-subscription`).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/high-reasoning-warning.ts`: fork-only file, no upstream counterpart.

## 2026-09-29 - The prompt surface is a per-session property (senpi#2377)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `AgentSessionConfig.promptSurface?: PromptSurface`; `_rebuildSystemPrompt` sets `surface: this._promptSurface ?? resolvePromptSurface(process.env)`, so a session built with a surface keeps it whatever the host process env says. New `setPromptSurface(surface)` rebuilds the base prompt (through `_applyToolDeclarations`) and clears the per-turn override; the next turn's `before_agent_start` hands presets the new surface.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`: `AgentSessionLaunchProfile.promptSurface?`; `_launchProfile` is no longer readonly, and `setPromptSurface(surface)` stores it on the launch profile (so `new_session` / `switch_session` / `fork` replacements keep it) and forwards it to the session.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`: `promptSurface?` passes through `createAgentSession` / `createAgentSessionFromServices` to the session config.

### Why

- A shared RPC host serves several clients from one process; a process-wide env var could not give the OmO Desktop (an app surface) and a terminal client different prompts on the same host. The surface now travels with each session's launch profile.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The base prompt options and the runtime launch profile are assembled in core before any extension runs.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `AgentSessionConfig` tail and the constructor's first line in `agent-session.ts`; `AgentSessionLaunchProfile` and the `_launchProfile` field in `agent-session-runtime.ts`; the `createAgentSession` options tail in `sdk.ts` and the `createAgentSessionFromServices` call in `agent-session-services.ts`.

## 2026-09-29 - The session reads SENPI_PROMPT_SURFACE into its system-prompt options (senpi#2377)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_rebuildSystemPrompt` sets `surface: resolvePromptSurface(process.env)` on `_baseSystemPromptOptions`, the one place the base prompt options are assembled; the dynamic prompt and (through `systemPromptOptions`) the prompt-preset extension read it from there.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-prompt.ts`: `BuildSystemPromptOptions.surface?: PromptSurface`, so extensions see the surface on `systemPromptOptions` / `ctx.getSystemPromptOptions()`. `buildSystemPrompt` ignores it.

### Why

- An app host (the OmO Desktop) needs prompts without the terminal routing line. The environment is read once at the option boundary rather than inside section builders, which stay pure.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The base prompt options are assembled in the session before `before_agent_start`; the fallback dynamic prompt is built there, not in an extension.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `_baseSystemPromptOptions` literal in `_rebuildSystemPrompt` and the dynamic-prompt import in `agent-session.ts`; the `BuildSystemPromptOptions` interface tail in `system-prompt.ts`.

## 2026-09-29 - A billing-dead fallback target no longer pins or strands the session (senpi#2376)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/controller.ts` (fork-only): a `billing` switch pins the episode only when the failure hit the chain's original model or that model's whole account; billing on a fallback target from another account leaves the episode revertable. `maybeRestorePrimary` returns to the original at a turn boundary when the current fallback is known unusable and the original is not, ahead of the original's cooldown and the `never` policy, and emits `retry_fallback_reverted` with `cause: "fallback-unusable"`. `tryFallback` and `noteHealthFailure` record what cannot serve; the candidate scan tries every spent provider's entries last for the life of that record instead of for one hop.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/pin.ts` (fork-only, new): `pinAfterSwitch` holds the pin-provenance rule `applyCandidate` applies (refusal pins; billing pins only when it hit the original or the original's account).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/unusable.ts` (fork-only, new): `UnusableEntries` records an account-scoped usage limit or billing failure per provider and a model-scoped one per entry, on the session's selector cooldowns under namespaced keys; a manual model change clears it for that model.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/candidates.ts` (fork-only): `CandidateFilters.spentProvider` becomes the predicate `isProviderSpent`; the second, spent-provider-permitting pass runs only when the first pass skipped a spent provider.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/controller-types.ts` (fork-only): `FallbackRevertCause` and the optional `cause` on `retry_fallback_reverted`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/cooldown.ts` (fork-only): a reason-less `forbidden` rejection cools a selector for 60 s instead of the 5-minute default.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the `retry_fallback_reverted` member of `AgentSessionEvent` carries the optional `cause`.

### Why

- Incident 2026-09-29: a transient subscription `forbidden` hopped the shipped `claude-opus-5-5` ladder onto an API-key provider with no credit. Its `credit balance is too low` answer pinned the whole episode as billing, so the session never returned to the original after the rejection stopped, and the same dead provider was retried on every rung because the account-limit skip lasted one hop. Sessions stayed on the dead provider until switched back by hand.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Fallback pinning, revert and candidate selection live in the core retry controller that `agent-session.ts` drives between turns; no hook sees or can veto them.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `retry_fallback_reverted` line of the `AgentSessionEvent` union in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-29 - Legacy `.pi` project resources follow project trust

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts`: `addAutoDiscoveredResources` discovers the legacy `<cwd>/.pi` project directories (extensions, skills, prompts, themes, hooks) only when the project is trusted, the same guard the config-dir blocks already use.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/trust-manager.ts`: `hasTrustRequiringProjectResources` checks the same trust-requiring entries under the legacy `<cwd>/.pi` directory as under the config dir, so a project whose only project resources are in `.pi/` asks for a trust decision.

### Why

- Project trust gating guarded only the config-dir (`.senpi`) blocks; the legacy `.pi` discovery added earlier sat outside that guard, and the trust check did not look at `.pi`, so `.pi` project resources loaded whatever the trust decision was.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Project resource discovery and the launch-time trust decision run in the host before any extension is bound; an extension cannot withhold resources the loader already discovered.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `if (projectTrusted && resolve(legacyProjectBaseDir) !== resolve(projectBaseDir))` condition in `addAutoDiscoveredResources` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts`.
- LOW: the config-dir check at the top of `hasTrustRequiringProjectResources` and the new `LEGACY_PROJECT_CONFIG_DIR_NAME` constant in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/trust-manager.ts`.

## 2026-09-29 - The package resolution memo key carries the project trust state (senpi#2371)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: `resolvePackagePaths()` passes `projectTrusted: this.settingsManager.isProjectTrusted()` into `resolvedPathsMemoKey`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resolved-paths-memo.ts` (fork-only): `ResolvedPathsMemoKeyInput` gains a required `projectTrusted: boolean`. Refresh, eviction and the promise memo are unchanged.

### Why

- `DefaultPackageManager.resolve()` reads `isProjectTrusted()` directly (project `.agents/skills` and project-scope resources are skipped while untrusted), but the senpi#1844 key did not include it. At startup without a cached decision, `reload()` resolves once in the untrusted pre-trust pass and again after the trust decision. With no project settings file both passes produced the same key, so the trusted pass reused the untrusted result and a project trusted through `trust.json` lost its `.agents/skills` for the whole session (missing from `/skill:` and from the system prompt). The same key let an untrusted open of a folder reuse a trusted open's result in the same process, so the untrusted open loaded that project's skills, extensions, prompt templates, themes and hooks without trust.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Package resolution and its memo run inside the host resource loader before any extension is bound.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `resolvedPathsMemoKey({...})` argument object in `resolvePackagePaths()` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` (one added line).

## 2026-09-29 - A refused delivery write, a part-written async header and a release's header write never leave a session stuck

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/external-admission.ts` (fork-only): `observeRefused(message, error)` settles a delivery whose entry the session file refused: it leaves `pending` (so its start stops counting as busy and the next delivery starts) and is recorded in a `failed` map with the error, listed by `list()` as `failed: [{ delivery_id, error }]` only while non-empty. `admit` answers `already_admitted` for a failed id. `observePersisted` (now called for every written message) and `observeRefused` record whether the file's last write succeeded, and `observeRunSettled` clears the map at the end of a run only when it did: a failed delivery is admissible again once the run that refused it has settled, so its redelivery starts or joins a later run, whose start (`takeRefusedOut`) has dropped the refused copy from the model context, and it is never queued into the refusing run (where the model would hold it twice).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the message-end write path calls `externalAdmission.observeRefused` when the session manager refuses the write, and `observePersisted` after every written message, not only custom ones; `_emitAgentSettled` calls `externalAdmission.observeRunSettled()` once the run is marked inactive, before the `agent_settled` and `agent_idle` edges whose drain may redeliver.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `_writeHeaderAsync` removes the file it created exclusively when any step after the open fails (a part-way `writeFile`, the close, a tail `appendFile`), through `discardFailedFirstFlushAsync`, and rethrows; the handle is closed exactly once.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-write-recovery.ts` (fork-only): `discardFailedFirstFlushAsync(path, handle, error)`, the asynchronous twin of `discardFailedFirstFlush`, sharing its error reporting (`AggregateError` when the cleanup fails too).
- Tests: `test/session-manager-header-write.test.ts` gains an assistant appended while the header write closes (lands once, in order; pins the header-write step-aside in `_persist`) and a part-way ENOSPC header write (no file left, next write persists every entry memory holds). `test/suite/external-admission-refused-write.test.ts` (new, real host, real `chmod 0444`), including a file that recovers mid-run: the retry inside the refusing run is `already_admitted`, the one after it settles starts, and the model context and the file each hold the delivery once.

### Why

Found in the todo-25 merge gate review of the session-gateway plan (senpi#2328), all three present since senpi#2365. A refused delivery write skipped `observePersisted`, so the delivery stayed `pending` with lane `start` and every later delivery was queued behind a turn that never ran. A part-way failure of the async header write left the half-written file, so every later first flush failed with `EEXIST` while entries appended during the failed write stayed in memory only. The step-aside (`if (this.headerWrite) return;`) had no test that fails without it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The admission ledger and the transcript write path are the session runtime's; the header write is the session manager's.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts`: the `message_end` persistence `try/catch` in `_processAgentEvent`.
- `session-manager.ts`: `_writeHeaderAsync` and the `session-write-recovery.ts` / `fs/promises` imports.

## 2026-09-29 - A failed session append leaves nothing an entry can chain onto

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `_appendEntry` writes the entry (`_persist`) before it commits it to `fileEntries`, `byId`, the leaf, the entry count and the usage totals, so a write that throws (EACCES, ENOSPC, a removed directory) leaves memory exactly as the file has it and the caller gets the error. `_persist` takes the not-yet-committed entry: an append to a flushed file that fails marks the tail as possibly torn and the next append first cuts the file back to its last complete line; a first flush that fails part-way removes the file it created exclusively, so the next flush can create it again. `appendSessionInfo` updates the name cache after the entry is written, and `branchWithSummary` no longer moves the leaf before its entry is written. A successful append writes the same bytes as before.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-write-recovery.ts` (new, fork-only): `truncateToLastCompleteLine` and `discardFailedFirstFlush`. `discardFailedFirstFlush` also closes the half-written file, so a failing close no longer skips the removal or the write error; cleanup failures are thrown beside the write error in an `AggregateError`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/transcript-write-failures.ts` (new, fork-only): `TranscriptWriteFailures`, the refused message writes of the session: the first error of a run to report once (`startRun` / `takeReport`), and the refused message objects to drop from the model context (`takeRefusedOut`).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: a message-end write the session manager refused no longer rejects the queued event work where nobody observes it. It is logged (`transcript_write_failed` with `role`), published as the new `transcript_write_failed` session event (`role`, `errorMessage`; RPC forwards it, which is how an RPC client learns about it after the prompt was accepted), the rest of the message-end handling runs, and the run's owner reports the first such error once: a run a `prompt` owns (`_promptOwnsRun`, from `_promptAgent` start until its event queue settles) has its `prompt` throw it after the queue settles, and any other run (retry, queued follow-up, compaction continuation) emits `continuation_error` right when the write fails. The continuation path never waits for the event queue, so it holds its session-work token no longer than before (waiting there delayed the next TTSR recovery generation). The next `_promptAgent` start, when nothing is streaming, drops exactly the refused message objects from `agent.state.messages`, so the next turn's model context equals a reload of the file.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-log.ts`: `role` joins the allowed data keys, so the `transcript_write_failed` line keeps it.

### Why

- `_appendEntry` pushed the entry into memory and only then wrote it. When the write threw, the entry stayed in memory as the leaf, and the next successful append was written with a `parentId` the file never received, so on reload the transcript lost everything after the break. Found while making `release_session` answer `release_failed` (the aborted reply and the stop-state stayed memory-only after a refused write); a refused rename followed by a written `session_released` entry reopened as a one-entry branch with no messages. Inside a turn the throw rejected one queued `_processAgentEvent`, which the next event's handler absorbed, so the prompt resolved as if the turn had been saved.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Entry ordering, the leaf and the JSONL writes are private to `SessionManager`, and the agent event queue is private to `AgentSession`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `_persist` and `_appendEntry` in `session-manager.ts` (restructured, plus `_commitEntry` split out of `_appendEntry`; upstream still writes after committing); one line each in `appendSessionInfo` and `branchWithSummary`.
- LOW: the `message_end` persistence block in `_processAgentEvent` (wrapped in a try/catch), the run-start and post-queue checks in `_promptAgent`, the `AgentSessionEvent` union (one new member) and one line before the continuation run in `_continueAgentAfterCurrentRun` in `agent-session.ts`; the `ALLOWED_DATA_KEY` pattern in `session-log.ts`.

## 2026-09-29 - Session file rewrites are atomic, so a failed migration keeps the original

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `_rewriteFile` no longer opens the session file with `"w"` and writes it in place; it hands the serialized entries (a lazy generator, `_serializedFileEntries`, so resident strings are materialized one entry at a time as before) to `replaceFileAtomically`. Every caller keeps its behavior: the version migration on open (`setSessionFile`, `_loadEntries`), the empty-file header write, the caller-id create, and `createBranchedSession`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-file-replace.ts` (new, fork-only): `replaceFileAtomically(path, chunks)` writes a hidden temp file in the target's directory (`.<name>.<uuid>.tmp`, invisible to `.jsonl` discovery), applies the existing file's mode, fsyncs it, renames it over the target (libuv uses `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING` on Windows), then fsyncs the directory (skipped on Windows; `EINVAL`/`ENOTSUP`/`EOPNOTSUPP`/`EISDIR` from a filesystem without directory fsync are tolerated because the rename already happened). A symlinked session file keeps its link: the replacement lands on the resolved file. On a failure before the rename the temp file is removed and the error is rethrown; if the removal also fails both errors surface as one `AggregateError`. When the directory refuses the temp file (`EACCES`/`EPERM`/`EROFS` on its exclusive open), the file is rewritten in place exactly as before, so a writable session file in a read-only directory still migrates on open.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/no-sync-in-session-path.ledger.json`: the transcript-rewrite `writeFileSync` entry moves from `session-manager.ts _rewriteFile` to `session-file-replace.ts writeDurably` (same count), plus one entry for the read-only-directory fallback `rewriteInPlace`.

### Why

- Opening an old-version session runs the version migration, which rewrote the whole transcript in place. An `ENOSPC` or `EIO` part-way through truncated the user's existing transcript (found by the session-gateway todo-25 gate review, note N3). Every other session write is an append; this was the one path that could destroy history that was already on disk.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The rewrite runs inside `SessionManager` construction and branching, before any extension is loaded.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the body of `_rewriteFile` plus the new `_serializedFileEntries` generator right after it, and one import line in `session-manager.ts`.

## 2026-09-29 - A listener that unsubscribes during an emit no longer hides that event from the next listener

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_emit` iterates a copy of `_eventListeners`. `unsubscribe()` splices the live array, so a listener that removed itself inside an emit shifted the next listener into the slot the loop had already passed, and that listener never saw the event. Every listener registered when the emit starts now receives it.

### Why

- A self-removing `agent_start` or `agent_idle` listener placed just before the control endpoint's subscription swallowed the endpoint's idle wake (a held delivery waited for the next edge), and one placed before a manual continue's listener pushed `.` acceptance back to the end of the turn (session gateway, todo 27). `ExternalAdmission`'s listener `Set`s and the control feed's `Map` are unaffected: deleting the current entry of a `Set` or `Map` during `for...of` does not skip the next one.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The listener list and its emit loop are private to `AgentSession`; the skipped listener is the one that cannot see the event.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the loop header in `_emit`.

## 2026-09-29 - `ExternalAdmission.close()`: admission ends when a host hands the session over

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/external-admission.ts`: `close(reason)` makes every later `admit()` throw `reason` and change nothing; `reopen()` undoes it. Additive: two methods, one field, and a first-line guard in `admit`; nothing else in the class changed.

### Why

`release_session` (modes/rpc) hands a session to another writer. A drain pass that was already running when the release claimed the session could still admit a delivery until the runtime was disposed, so its entry, the reply and a stop-state landed after `session_released`. The release now closes admission in the same synchronous step as its claim; the delivery stays with its sender, which redelivers it to the new owner.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The drain is the extension; it cannot know the host is about to tear its session down.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The field list, the method after `onEmitted`, and the first line of `admit` in `external-admission.ts`.

## 2026-09-29 - Atomic external-message admission, its ledger, and a durable header on demand

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/external-admission.ts` (new): `ExternalAdmission` - `admit({ delivery_id, text, deliverAs, expected_turn_id? })` decides and acts in one synchronous call: `already_admitted` when this runtime holds the id (either queue, or a started turn not yet written) or already wrote it; `held_draft` while the composer holds a draft/attachment (nothing enqueued); `turn_conflict` when `expected_turn_id` is stale, or a mid-turn steer names none; `started` when idle (one `sendCustomMessage(..., { triggerTurn: true })`); mid-turn `steered` (one `agent.steer`) or `queued` (one `agent.followUp`). The message is a `session_control_delivery` custom message whose `details.delivery_id` is written to the transcript entry. `list()` is the process-lifetime ledger `{ pending, emitted }`; `gate()` is the read-only `{ can_admit, hold_reason?, editor_revision, turn_epoch }`; `onEmitted` fires when a delivery's entry is persisted.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: owns `externalAdmission` (busy = a run is active or a prompt claimed its start); `_promptAgent` advances `turn_epoch` when a run begins; the custom-message `message_end` persistence reports the entry to the ledger; `clearQueue()` drops queued deliveries from it; `bindCore` binds `sessionControl` (`session-control-actions.ts`, new); `setControlEndpointHost(host)` lets the interactive mode provide `registerControlEndpoint`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` (manual continue): a bare `.` reports acceptance (`promptDisposition("handled")` + `preflightResult(true)`, unchanged values) once the runtime took the continuation - after its turn's `agent_start`, or at once when it was queued into a running turn - instead of after the whole continued turn, so the admission hold and the TUI's submission ticket end like an ordinary prompt's and a mid-turn follow-up delivery is `queued`, not `held_draft`. A continuation that never starts reports at the end, as before.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `persistHeaderNow(): Promise<void>` writes the buffered header (and anything buffered behind it) asynchronously through an exclusive create (`fs/promises` `open("wx")`), then sets `flushed`, after which every entry appends immediately. While that write runs, `_persist` leaves the file to it (the `!flushed` branch returns early) and the write appends every entry persisted meanwhile - including while its handle closes - before it sets the flag in the same synchronous step as its last check, so the session path gains no synchronous filesystem call (`test/suite/no-sync-in-session-path.test.ts`). `isTranscriptFlushed()`; `async discardHeaderOnlyFile()` waits for a pending header write, then removes a file that holds only the header and model/thinking setup entries and returns to buffering (so a later entry cannot recreate a header-less file).

### Why

Session gateway: a delivery from another session must be applied exactly once per process (the drain retries on every edge), must never jump ahead of or into the user's draft, and must leave a durable, greppable proof on disk (`delivery_id` in the session JSONL). A registered session's id must be on disk before it is visible, because reopening a missing file mints a new id.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Whether the runtime already holds a message in its steering or follow-up queue, when a run begins, and when the transcript entry is written are all internal to `AgentSession` and `SessionManager`; `pi.sendMessage` gives an extension neither the answer nor atomicity.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts`: the `_pendingCustomMessages` field block, the `_isAgentRunActive = true` line in `_promptAgent`, the custom branch of `message_end` persistence in `_processAgentEvent`, `clearQueue()`, the end of the `bindCore` actions literal, and `setControlEndpointHost` beside `get sessionName`.
- `session-manager.ts`: the methods before `_persist` and its `!this.flushed` branch; `SETUP_ONLY_ENTRY_TYPES` before the class.

## 2026-09-29 - A rejected request re-asks the compaction owner before its retry (senpi#2329)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_runAutoCompaction` and `_runPrePromptCompaction` no longer return early on `_isCompactionDelegated()` for an `overflow` whose request failed and will be retried (`willRetry`); the owning extension is consulted again. Threshold and pre-prompt routes, and an overflow classified on a completed turn, keep the sticky short-circuit (#1174).

### Why

- An `external-owner` rejection records `_delegatedCompactionKey`, and every later route returned before asking the owner, overflow included. Whether the owner can recover an overflow depends on the request that failed: on the `anthropic-subscription` lane a cold-seed re-sends senpi's own history as one message the SDK cannot compact, and the lane policy now claims that overflow. With the short-circuit in place an earlier threshold rejection kept that recovery from ever running, so the session died at "Prompt is too long" (oh-my-openagent#7975).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The short-circuit sits in front of `session_before_compact`; no extension hook runs before it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the first line of `_runAutoCompaction` and `_runPrePromptCompaction` in `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-29 - Surface-neutral unknown-command message (senpi#2348)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/unknown-command.ts` (fork-only): the `UnknownCommandError` message is `Unknown command /foo. Did you mean /food?` with no surface advice; each surface appends its own confirm step. New export `UNKNOWN_COMMAND_CONFIRM_HINT` for protocol clients (RPC, app-server).

### Why

- The TUI confirms with a second Enter and protocol clients with `unknownCommandAsText`; one hardcoded "start the message with a space" line was wrong for both.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The message belongs to the core typed error.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- None: fork-only file.

## 2026-09-29 - Together's default model is Kimi K3 (senpi#2321)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: `defaultModelPerProvider.together` moves from `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` to `moonshotai/Kimi-K3`.

### Why

- models.dev retired Together's Kimi K2.6 and K2.7 Code rows in the 2026-09-29 catalog regeneration (`packages/ai/changes.md`), so `test/model-resolver.test.ts` ("every bundled provider default resolves in its catalog") failed on the old default. Kimi K3 is the Moonshot model Together still lists. Hugging Face and Baseten keep K2.6.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Bundled provider defaults.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: one line in `defaultModelPerProvider`.

## 2026-09-29 - The model runtime installs the Claude Code version cache (senpi#2321)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: `ModelRuntime.create` and `createSync` call `installClaudeCodeVersionFileStore` (from `@earendil-works/pi-ai/utils/claude-code-version-cache`) with `<dirname(models.json)>/claude-code-version.json` and `offline: envValue("OFFLINE") !== undefined`, so every host with a models.json (CLI, SDK, RPC, app-server, daemon, session worker) shares one on-disk Claude Code version cache and one background lookup per six hours. An in-memory runtime (`modelsPath: null`, tests) keeps pi-ai's bundled floor.

### Why

- pi-ai's resolver is browser-safe and holds no filesystem; the host decides where the cache lives, and `ModelRuntime.create` is the one place every mode passes through with the agent directory resolved.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Extensions load after the runtime exists and cannot reach pi-ai's module state before the first request.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the import block and the two `create` entry points in `model-runtime.ts`.

## 2026-09-29 - Ambient cloud credentials never make their provider the automatic default (senpi#2327)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-default-selection.ts` (new): `isAmbientOnlyProvider`, `createAmbientProviderCheck`, and `selectProviderDefault(available, providerDefaults, source)`. Selection considers models from providers whose auth status is not `ambient` first; ambient-only providers only when nothing else is available. Within that group the first available `providerDefaults` entry wins (`provider-default`), else the group's first model (`first-available`).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: `findInitialModel` step 4 and the `restoreModelFromSession` fallback call `selectProviderDefault` instead of walking `defaultModelPerProvider` in key order over every available model. `defaultModelPerProvider` gains `anthropic-subscription: claude-opus-4-8` (same default as `anthropic`), so a Claude subscription login has a provider default at all.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: `getProviderAuthStatus` returns `ambient: true` for environment auth whose `AuthCheck` is ambient.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`: `AuthStatus` gains optional `ambient?: true`.

### Why

- With AWS keys in the environment (kept for S3, deploys, ...) and no saved default, the key-order walk picked `amazon-bedrock` (2nd key) over every later provider, and a Claude subscription never matched the walk because it had no table entry. The session started on Bedrock even for users logged in elsewhere; the recommended-models switch hides it only outside app-server mode and only when a ladder model is available (senpi#2327).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Initial model selection runs in core before extensions bind (see the recommended-models note: the resolver reads provider defaults first), and restore fallback happens inside `restoreModelFromSession`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: step 4 of `findInitialModel` and the fallback tail of `restoreModelFromSession` in `model-resolver.ts`, plus the `anthropic-subscription` row in `defaultModelPerProvider`; upstream edits to that table land beside it.
- LOW: the environment return of `getProviderAuthStatus` in `model-runtime.ts`; the `AuthStatus` type in `provider-composer.ts`.

## 2026-09-29 - The resource loader no longer carries `sharedHostEnabled` (senpi#2328)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: `DefaultResourceLoaderOptions.sharedHostEnabled` and the private `sharedHostEnabled` field of `DefaultResourceLoader` are removed. The constructor builds the extension session profile from `sessionKind` and `sessionContext` only, because `pi.sharedHostEnabled` is removed from the extension API (`src/core/extensions/changes.md`, same date).

### Why

- The option only fed `pi.sharedHostEnabled`, which could be `true` only inside the removed interactive shared-host join (senpi#2328).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The resource loader constructs the extension runtime before any extension loads.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `DefaultResourceLoaderOptions`, the field list, and the `extensionSession` assignment in the `DefaultResourceLoader` constructor.

## 2026-09-29 - The retired `experimental.sharedHost` setting is removed from the settings file (senpi#2328)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `ExperimentalSettings`, `Settings.experimental` and `getExperimentalSharedHost()` are removed. `loadFromStorage` runs `removeRetiredSettingsKeys` on the raw parsed object of each scope before `migrateSettings`, so the key is ignored in memory for both scopes; when it was present in the GLOBAL scope, `writeRawScopedSettings` rewrites that file. A project file is never rewritten, and a file without the key is never written.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-retired-keys.ts` (new): `removeRetiredSettingsKeys(raw)` deletes `experimental.sharedHost` and drops `experimental` once empty. `writeRawScopedSettings(storage, scope)` re-parses the content seen under the storage lock, removes the retired keys, and writes `JSON.stringify(raw, null, 2)` without `migrateSettings()`, so every other key keeps its parsed value exactly (legacy `queueMode`, `retry.maxDelayMs`, provider ids stay in their legacy shape). A global `settings.jsonc` loses its comments in that one write. A failed write never fails the load; after it fails for a settings file, no later `SettingsManager` in the process retries it, and it is recorded once in the brand debug log.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-json.ts` (new): `parseSettingsJson` moves here unchanged and `settings-manager.ts` re-exports it, so `settings-retired-keys.ts` parses without a runtime import of `settings-manager.ts` (no import cycle).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/hidden-stdout-log.ts`: `appendDebugLogEntry` is exported so settings loading can record the failed rewrite.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: the `sharedHostEnabled` fallback no longer reads the removed setting (`options.sharedHostEnabled ?? false`); the option itself is removed with the extension API field separately.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/shared-host-policy.ts`: deleted.

### Why

- The interactive shared-host join is removed (senpi#2328), so the setting controls nothing. Leaving it in users' files would keep a dead key forever; the normal save path (`persistScopedSettings`) re-runs every migration before serializing and would rewrite unrelated legacy fields, so the removal needs its own raw write.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Settings parsing, migration and persistence are owned by `SettingsManager` and run before extensions load.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the tail of `SettingsManager.loadFromStorage`, the `Settings` interface, and the getter block around `getDefaultTools` in `settings-manager.ts`.
- LOW: the `sharedHostEnabled` assignment in the `DefaultResourceLoader` constructor.

## 2026-09-29 - A usage limit skips the rest of a spent account and names itself in the fallback notice (omo#8296)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/usage-limit.ts` (new): `usageLimitScope(errorMessage)` reads a failure as a usage limit (quota exhaustion, billing, or subscription limit prose such as "You've hit your session limit") and scopes it: `model` when the message names a model, a model family, or premium models; `account` otherwise. `usageLimitCause(from, limit)` renders the notice clause.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/candidates.ts`: `CandidateFilters.spentProvider` moves that provider's entries to the end of the scan: `firstUsableCandidate` first looks for a usable entry on any other provider (skip reason `account-limit`), and only then rescans with the spent provider included.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/controller.ts`: `tryFallback` scopes `failure.errorMessage`; an account-wide limit passes the failed model's provider as `spentProvider`, so the chain reaches another provider before spending a request on a sibling model of the spent account. A chain with no other usable provider still hops to the sibling rather than stopping. `retry_fallback_applied` and the `fallback_applied` log line carry `limit` when a usage limit caused the switch.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/controller-types.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the `retry_fallback_applied` event type gains optional `limit?: "model" | "account"`.

### Why

- A Claude session or weekly limit, a Codex usage limit, or an empty balance binds the whole account: the next model on the same provider fails the same way, so the chain burned a request on it before reaching another provider. A model-scoped limit (a Fable-only weekly cap, Copilot premium models) still moves to the next model on the same provider. The notice said `(transient)` or `(hard-error)` and never that a limit caused the switch (omo#8296).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Candidate selection and the `retry_fallback_applied` event live inside `RetryFallbackController`, which no extension hook reaches.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `retry_fallback_applied` member of the `AgentSessionEvent` union in `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-28 - A stored OAuth token the provider refuses is re-exchanged once before failing (senpi#2297)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: `stream` and `streamSimple` (single-credential and rotation lanes) send each attempt through the new private `attemptWithTokenRecovery`, which uses `credential-pool/rejected-token-retry.ts` (`retryOnceOnRejectedToken`). `prepareRequest` forwards `rejectedAccess` to auth resolution and reports the stored OAuth access it used plus the provider's `rejectedTokenStatuses`. When the first pre-output event is an error whose `providerDiagnostic.httpStatus` is one of those statuses, the attempt is re-run once with that token named as rejected; pre-commit frames of the refused attempt are held back so the caller sees one stream. `ModelRuntimeAuthOverrides` gains `rejectedAccess`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/rotation-events.ts`: `rotationErrorFromEvent` attaches the terminal event's `providerDiagnostic.httpStatus` as `status` on the failure it builds, so `classifyCredentialFailure` sees the HTTP status for stream-event failures (before, only message text was classified, and a bodyless 403 always fell through to `fail_request`). When a freshly re-exchanged token is refused too, `rejected-token-retry.ts` appends an account-scoped sentence, so the pool blocks that slot (`auth_error`, lifted by a new login) and fails over to a healthy sibling account within the same request.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/cooldown.ts`: `SelectorCooldowns` strips provider request ids before matching status words, so an id containing `429` or `5xx` digits cannot pick the cooldown.

### Why

- GitHub revoked Copilot tokens server-side while senpi still believed them valid; every model returned HTTP 403 until the token's own 24h expiry, in single-account sessions and on a pinned pool slot alike (senpi#2297).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The retry must happen before any output reaches the session and must re-resolve auth for the same slot; both live in `ModelRuntime`, below every extension hook.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: the `runAttempt` callbacks and single-credential tails of `stream`/`streamSimple`, and the `prepareRequest` return shape in `model-runtime.ts`.
- LOW: `rotationErrorFromEvent` in `credential-pool/rotation-events.ts`.
- LOW: `durationFor` in `retry-fallback/cooldown.ts`.

## 2026-09-28 - models.json accepts supportsForcedToolChoice on OpenAI compat (senpi#2218)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config-schema.ts`: `OpenAICompletionsCompatSchema` and `OpenAIResponsesCompatSchema` accept an optional boolean `supportsForcedToolChoice`, matching the new `OpenAICompletionsCompat` / `OpenAIResponsesCompat` field in `packages/ai`.

### Why

- A provider known to accept only automatic tool choice (Kiro behind an OpenAI-compatible proxy, senpi#2218) needs a way to say so in `models.json`, so no request ever forces a tool on it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `models.json` is validated against this schema before any extension runs; an unknown compat key is rejected here.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the two OpenAI compat schema objects when upstream adds compat keys.

## 2026-09-28 - /sessions alias of /resume (#1437)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts`: a `sessions` row in `BUILTIN_SLASH_COMMANDS` after `resume`, described as the `/resume` alias, so autocomplete and `/help` list it.

### Why

- Users arriving from OpenCode type `/sessions` to reopen a session; with no such command the text was sent to the model and they concluded the harness could not resume sessions (#1437 report thread).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `slash-commands.ts` is the host builtin catalog read by `/help` and autocomplete, and the alias must open the interactive session selector that only `InteractiveMode` owns; an extension command cannot open it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts`: the row after `resume` in `BUILTIN_SLASH_COMMANDS`.

## 2026-09-28 - Unknown commands are refused before the model; skills declare argument hints (omo #9042)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/unknown-command.ts` (fork-only): `UnknownCommandError` (`command`, `suggestions`, `reason`), `commandShapedName`, `findUnknownCommand`, and `unknownCommandErrorFromWire` for the RPC client.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `PromptOptions.unknownCommandAsText`. In `prompt()`, after the `input` event and skill/template expansion, text that expansion left unchanged, from a source other than `extension`, without the opt-out, and not starting with whitespace, goes through `_rejectUnknownCommand`, which throws when the leading `/name` token names no extension command, prompt template, or loaded `skill:<name>` (TUI builtins get `reason: "interactive_only"`). The throw sits inside the prompt's try block, so the input disposition is `rejected`, `preflightResult(false)` fires, and no user message is built or persisted.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts`: `Skill.argumentHint` from the `argument-hint` frontmatter string (trimmed, omitted when empty); `SkillFrontmatter` declares the field.

### Why

- Text such as `/ulw-exec plan` that no command handles went to the model as a user message, spending a turn on a typo. The check must run after the input transforms because extensions (the omo plugin) rewrite bare skill aliases such as `/ulw-execute plan` into `/skill:ulw-execute plan` there.
- The slash picker needs to know which skills take arguments.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- An `input` handler runs before expansion and cannot see whether a later handler, a template, or a skill will resolve the text, and extension handler order is not a contract. Only the session knows the full command catalog after expansion. Skill frontmatter is parsed in core.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `PromptOptions`, the expansion block in `prompt()`, the new `_rejectUnknownCommand` above `_expandSkillCommand`, and the imports.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts`: `SkillFrontmatter`, `Skill`, and the returned skill object in `loadSkillFromFile`.

## 2026-09-27 - Fallback-chain entries that fail out of their chain are circuit-broken across sessions; /session reports failure cost (senpi#2198)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the constructor binds a `FallbackCircuitAccess` (`core/retry-fallback/circuit.ts`, new) to the breaker shared per resolved agent dir (`fallbackCircuitsFor(this._agentDir)`; each `/new`, `/resume`, and `/fork` gets a fresh `ModelRuntime` from the CLI factory, so the runtime cannot be the key), with the session id as probe owner, the injected fallback clock, and live `fallback.*` settings, and hands it to `RetryFallbackController`. An accepted assistant response closes its model's circuit; a successful probe-back closes it too. `_maybeRestoreFallbackPrimary` also runs `rerouteAroundOpenCircuit()`, so every turn boundary moves a session off an entry whose circuit another session opened. `getSessionStats()` adds `failures` from `computeSessionFailureReport` (`core/session-failure-report.ts`, new).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `Settings.fallback` (`circuitCooldownMs`, `circuitMaxCooldownMs`) and `getFallbackCircuitSettings()`.
- Review round (senpi#2201): `circuit.ts` admission is atomic (`admit()` returns `closed` / `open` / a `probe` token keyed by owner and circuit generation, released by token), probes never expire on a timer, a Retry-After deadline is a floor later hintless failures cannot shorten, idle circuits and empty agent-dir breakers are swept, and the default clock is monotonic. `retry-fallback/circuit-probes.ts` (new) holds a session's one probe token and `isHealthExhaustionFailure`; `controller-types.ts` (new) takes the controller's type declarations. `agent-session.ts` records billing/quota exhaustion at `agent_end` for any chain entry, accepts a probe on its first streamed delta, falls back on a probe's first transient failure (no same-model retries), hands the probe back on every other terminal path and on dispose, gates the 429 probe-back scheduler on circuit admission, and aborts a probe that never answers after the stream-start guard when that guard is disabled. `session-failure-report.ts` counts post-failure retries within one user turn only.
- Second review round (senpi#2201): the registry keeps one entry per agent dir with an owner count; each `AgentSession` holds it through `acquireFallbackCircuits` for its lifetime and releases it on dispose, and an entry is evicted only when unheld and empty. Probe admission is per request lane (`turn` for the foreground, `probe-back:<n>` for each background probe) with a fresh generation on every acquisition, so a stale token never releases a later probe and a probe-back in flight keeps the same session's turn off the entry. Selector cooldowns and probe schedules default to the monotonic clock, and a fallback returns to an entry the breaker tracks when its circuit allows it rather than when the per-session cooldown lapses.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: `createAgentSession` disposes the constructed session when its startup model-usability check refuses it (a `ModelUsabilityBudgetError` or anything else rethrown), because the caller never receives that session to dispose; before, a refused startup kept its breaker hold, session writer, and blob directory for the life of the process (third review round of senpi#2201). `agent-session.ts` also takes the breaker hold as the constructor's last step and resolves the breaker through it lazily, so a constructor that throws never leaves a hold only `dispose()` could release.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/controller.ts`: `tryFallback` opens the current entry's circuit for `transient` and `billing` failures under a managed chain (advance and exhaustion), claims the half-open probe of the entry it switches to, and shares `applyCandidate` with the new `rerouteAroundOpenCircuit`; `maybeRestorePrimary` waits for the primary's circuit and claims its probe; a manual model change closes that model's circuit. `core/retry-fallback/candidates.ts` (extracted from the controller) skips circuit-open entries and returns the first of them only when no closed entry is left.

### Why

- Fallback cooldowns lived in one `AgentSession`, never escalated, and were invisible to new sessions and in-process subagents, so a dead provider cost its full retry budget again in every session and after every revert (senpi#2198, prior art gajae-code #5965).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Chain candidate selection, the turn-boundary revert, and the accepted-response signal all live inside `AgentSession`'s retry pipeline, and `SessionStats` is the core stats contract behind `/session` and `get_session_stats`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: two imports, one field, the constructor after `_fallbackNow`, the controller deps, the `succeeded` block of the assistant `message_end` handler, the probe-back `onCleared`, `_maybeRestoreFallbackPrimary`, `SessionStats`, and the `getSessionStats` return.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: one import, one `Settings` field, one getter.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: the `assertModelUsable` block near the end of `createAgentSession` is wrapped in an outer try that disposes on rethrow.
- LOW (review round): `agent-session.ts` `agent_start`/`message_update` branches of `_processAgentEvent`, the `agent_end` retry block head and tail, the probe-back `runProbe`, `dispose`, and one `else if` arm in `_handleRetryableError` before the transient branch.

## 2026-09-27 - Model-declared default thinking level (senpi#2196)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`: `modelFromJson` carries a models.json model's `defaultThinkingLevel` onto the runtime model (the fork-only `model-config-schema.ts` accepts it as one of the seven levels).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: startup resolution uses `model.defaultThinkingLevel` after the session entry and the remembered per-model level and before `settings.defaultThinkingLevel` / `medium`; it stays a default without selection provenance and is clamped like any other level.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_getThinkingForModelSwitch` applies the same order when switching models.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts`: `ModelConfig.validationError(content, path)` exposes the load-time parse and schema check so `senpi models discover` refuses to replace models.json with content that would not load.

### Why

- An OpenAI-compatible endpoint can declare a model's default effort (`reasoning_efforts[].default`); `senpi models discover` records it, and must validate what it writes with the same rules models.json is loaded with. The global setting tracks the last level picked on any model, so a model's own default is the better starting point for a model the user has not configured.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Initial and model-switch thinking resolution happen inside session creation and `AgentSession` before any extension hook can change the level without recording it as a user choice.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: the thinking-level resolution block before `settingsManager.getDefaultThinkingLevel()`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_getThinkingForModelSwitch` before the configured-default branch.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`: the `modelFromJson` object literal after `thinkingLevelMap`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts`: the static method before `parseAndMigrate`.

## 2026-09-27 - Sessions are held against moves by other processes; SessionInfo carries the recorded repository (senpi#2184)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`: the runtime publishes a holder record for the session file it has open (`holdSessionFile`, `src/core/session-holders.ts`) in its constructor and on every `apply`, releases it in `teardownCurrent` and `dispose`, and exposes `releaseSessionHold()` for the RPC registry's replacement runtime. `switchSession` takes the hold for the target before tearing the current session down, so a session another process is moving (or has moved) fails the switch instead of being appended to at its old path.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `SessionInfo` gains optional `repositoryIdentity` (latest `repository-identity` entry, read by the fork-only summary in `session-summary.ts`, index version 2) and `moved` (set by `src/core/moved-sessions.ts` on sessions of the current repository recorded at a path that no longer exists).

### Why

- A rebind copied and removed the session file with no cross-process protection, so a second process still writing the session at its old path recreated a header-less file and lost writes; the session lists had no way to recognise a moved repository's sessions (senpi#2184).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session ownership has to follow the runtime's session replacement lifecycle, and `SessionInfo` is the core listing contract consumed by the pickers.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`: the constructor tail, `teardownCurrent` after `unregisterSessionWriter`, `apply`, `switchSession` around `teardownCurrent` / `apply`, `dispose`, the module-level `holdActiveSession`, and one import.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: the `SessionInfo` interface tail and one type import.

## 2026-09-27 - A provider-rejected image no longer poisons later turns (senpi#2170)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-rejected-images.ts` (new): `omitProviderRejectedImages()` scans converted history. When an assistant turn failed with a provider image rejection (`does not represent a valid image`, `invalid base64` data URL, `unsupported image`, and similar), every image that no successful response had accepted before it is replaced by `[Image omitted: the provider rejected this image (<source>) ...]`. The source is the `path` argument of the tool call that produced the image, or "an attached image". `rejectedImageSources()` returns the sources a given failed turn rejected.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/messages.ts`: `convertToLlm()` applies `omitProviderRejectedImages()` right before `dropFailedAssistantTurns()`, while the failed turn is still visible.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: when an unhandled error turn rejected images, its `errorMessage` names the file(s) and says they are left out of later requests, next to the existing Cursor quota note.

### Why

`dropFailedAssistantTurns()` removed the failed turn but replayed the rejected image, so Codex rejected every later request, text-only ones included. Because the rejection is derived from the persisted failed turn, the recovery also holds after a restart and never rewrites session entries. Images from turns a later response accepted are kept, and other errors drop nothing.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The `context` hook cannot see failed assistant turns in a form that ties a rejection to the images it covered, and the terminal error text is composed inside `AgentSession`'s agent-end handling.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `return` of `convertToLlm()` in `messages.ts`.
- LOW: the Cursor quota note block in the agent-end handler of `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-28 - OpenCode Go default follows the catalog after v2026.9.28-4 (senpi#2295)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: the built-in `opencode-go` default is now `kimi-k3`, because the release-regenerated catalog no longer lists `kimi-k2.6`.

### Why

- A default that is missing from its provider catalog cannot resolve, and `model-resolver.test.ts` failed on main.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Built-in default model table.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `opencode-go` row of the defaults table.

## 2026-09-27 - Fireworks default follows the catalog after v2026.9.27 (senpi#2175)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: the built-in `fireworks` default is now `accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k3`, because the release-regenerated catalog no longer lists `kimi-k2p6`.

### Why

- A default that is missing from its provider catalog cannot resolve, and `model-resolver.test.ts` failed on main.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Built-in default model table.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `fireworks` row of the defaults table.

## 2026-09-27 - Tool kernel preludes, tool-owned permission parsers, and `tool_activated`

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `getAllTools()` projects each tool's `kernelPrelude` (validated by `extensions/kernel-prelude.ts`) and `permissionParser`. `setActiveToolsByName` emits `tool_activated` with only the newly active tool names, and nothing awaits the handlers.

### Why

- Extensions need three generic hooks so a capability can live entirely in an extension package: eval-kernel globals for their tools, permission tiers for their own tools, and a signal when a deferred tool becomes active.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Tool metadata projection and active-set changes happen inside `AgentSession`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `getAllTools()` field list and the tail of `setActiveToolsByName`.

## 2026-09-27 - Session titles on endpoints that mandate reasoning (senpi#2163)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-title-reasoning.ts` (new): `initialTitleReasoning()` returns the lowest supported level when the catalog says a model cannot turn reasoning off, otherwise `undefined`. `mandatoryReasoningRetryLevel()` returns `clampThinkingLevel(model, "low")` for one retry after a reasoning-free request failed with "Reasoning is mandatory".
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-title-generator.ts`: `generateSessionTitle()` sends that level and raises `maxTokens` from 64 to 1024 when reasoning is on. It retries once when a stale catalog entry hits the mandatory 400. Normal models keep the reasoning-free 64-token request.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_generateSessionTitle()` writes a `session_title_failed` debug line to `logs/session.log` instead of emitting the `session_title_generation` runtime error.

### Why

With `reasoning` unset, `openai-completions` sends the provider's disabled value (`reasoning: { effort: "none" }` on OpenRouter). Mandatory-reasoning endpoints (`meta/muse-spark-1.3-contributor`, Z.ai GLM 5.3) answered with a deterministic 400, and every session showed a runtime-error toast for a cosmetic background call. A missing title is not a runtime error, so failures stay in the session log. This supersedes senpi#1266, which only added the reactive retry.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Title generation is internal background work started from `AgentSession`. Extensions cannot change its request options, retry, or error reporting.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `catch` block of `_generateSessionTitle()` in `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-25 - An extension-triggered turn emits `before_agent_start` with `trigger: "extension"` (senpi#2137)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the `sendCustomMessage(..., { triggerTurn: true })` path passes `{ trigger: "extension" }` to `emitBeforeAgentStart`; the user-prompt path and the preview keep the runner's default `"prompt"`. The event field itself is recorded in `extensions/changes.md`.

### Why

The todotools first-turn plan opener could not tell a user request from an extension's hidden bootstrap turn and armed on omo's onboarding greeting, skipping the user's real first request.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Only the host knows which path started the turn.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The `emitBeforeAgentStart` call inside the `triggerTurn` branch of `sendCustomMessage`.

## 2026-09-25 - `todo.turnEndBackstop` setting (senpi#2121)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-shapes.ts`: `TodoSettings.turnEndBackstop`, default `true`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `getTodoTurnEndBackstop()`, which returns the merged value and falls back to `true` for a missing or non-boolean value.
- `packages/coding-agent/docs/settings.md`: a `todo.turnEndBackstop` row in the Todo section.

### Why

The goal builtin's turn-end backstop (`builtin/goal/todo-owed-backstop.ts`) needs a user switch to silence the hidden nudge for sessions that want unattended turns to end without it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Settings shapes and their resolved defaults live in the settings manager; the goal builtin reads the resolved value through `SettingsManager` the way todotools reads `todo.firstTurnPlan`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `TodoSettings` interface in `settings-shapes.ts`; the getter block next to `getTodoFirstTurnPlan()` in `settings-manager.ts`; the Todo table in `docs/settings.md`.

## 2026-09-25 - `todo.firstTurnPlan` setting (senpi#2121)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-shapes.ts`: `TodoFirstTurnPlan` (`"force" | "remind" | "off"`) and `TodoSettings.firstTurnPlan`, default `"force"`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `Settings.todo` and `getTodoFirstTurnPlan()`, which returns the merged value and falls back to `"force"` for a missing or unknown value.
- `packages/coding-agent/docs/settings.md`: a Todo section documents the setting.

### Why

The todotools first-turn plan opener (`builtin/todotools/first-turn.ts`) needs a user switch between forcing the opening `todo` call, only reminding, and disabling both.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Settings shapes and their resolved defaults live in the settings manager; the builtin reads the resolved value through `SettingsManager` like the other settings-driven builtins.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `Settings` interface and the getter block next to `getAskUserSettings()` in `settings-manager.ts`; the `settings-shapes.ts` import list.

## 2026-09-24 - Fold the environment context into the user message it precedes (senpi#2118)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/messages.ts`: `convertToLlm` records the converted form of every `environment-context` custom message and, after `dropFailedAssistantTurns`, passes the list through `foldEnvironmentContextIntoNextUserMessage`. An environment context immediately followed by a user-role message becomes that message's leading content block(s) (same text); one that no user message follows stays a standalone user message.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/environment-context.ts` (fork-only): new `foldEnvironmentContextIntoNextUserMessage(messages, environmentMessages)`.

### Why

- The #2093 environment-context message reached every provider as a user message right before the prompt. Bedrock and Gemini were folded in their converters (#2114), but OpenAI Chat Completions still sent two consecutive user messages, which alternation-enforcing chat templates (vLLM's Mistral tool template, Gemma 3) reject. Folding at conversion keeps persistence, rollover, and resume unchanged, keeps the system prompt byte-stable, and fixes the user message bytes once they are sent, so prefix caches are unaffected.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `convertToLlm` is the host's AgentMessage-to-LLM projection and runs after every `context` hook; an extension cannot reshape its output for every transport, compaction, and side-query caller.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `environment-context.ts` import, the `environmentMessages` set, the `custom` case, and the final `return` of `convertToLlm` in `messages.ts`.

## 2026-09-24 - Build the prompt-cache prefix only from preview-safe handlers and cancel it when a turn starts (senpi#2115)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the session owns one `PromptCachePrefixBuilds` (`_promptCachePrefixBuilds`). The `getPromptCachePrefixRequest` context action delegates to `_promptCachePrefixBuilds.build(...)` with the new `ready: this._sessionStartSettled` source and the caller's `{ signal }` option, and both real `before_agent_start` emits (`prompt()` and the `triggerTurn` custom-message path) call `_promptCachePrefixBuilds.cancelAll()` immediately before `emitBeforeAgentStart`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/prompt-cache-prefix-request.ts` (fork-only): `buildPromptCachePrefixRequest(sources, signal)` now returns a `PromptCachePrefixResult`. It waits for `sources.ready`, returns `skipped` without running any handler when `runner.getPreviewUnsafeBeforeAgentStartPaths()` is non-empty, passes `{ preview: true, signal }` to the preview pass, and resolves `skipped` with the abort reason (`PROMPT_STARTED_REASON` when a turn cancelled it) as soon as the signal aborts, without waiting for a stalled handler. `PromptCachePrefixBuilds` tracks each in-flight build's `AbortController` (linked to the caller's signal through `AbortSignal.any`) so `cancelAll()` stops every build.

### Why

The #2096 preview pass ran every `before_agent_start` handler with `event.preview: true`, but extensions written before that flag existed do not check it. An external memory extension that drains and marks notices delivered in `before_agent_start` lost them to the preview: the returned message was discarded and no turn followed. A preview also ran concurrently with the first real turn's `before_agent_start` when the user typed before it finished, so the same handlers raced on shared state.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The preview pass, its handler selection, and the moment a real turn dispatches `before_agent_start` are all host-owned; an extension cannot stop the host from invoking another extension's handler, nor observe the real turn's dispatch before it happens.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `prompt-cache-prefix-request.ts` import and the `_sessionStartSettled` field block, the `getPromptCachePrefixRequest` context action, and the two `this._refreshToolDeclarationsForModel()` + `emitBeforeAgentStart` pairs in `prompt()` and the `triggerTurn` branch of custom-message delivery in `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-24 - Count session-start prompt-cache prewarm usage and build its request from the first turn's prefix (senpi#2096)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `getSessionStats` adds the usage of `prompt-cache-prewarm` custom entries in phase `warmed` (read through `getPromptCachePrewarmUsage` from `extensions/builtin/cache-keepalive/prewarm-entry.ts`) to the token and cost totals. The new `getPromptCachePrefixRequest` context action waits for `_sessionStartSettled` (settled by `bindExtensions` and by the reload `session_start` path once session_start handlers, default-tool enforcement, and `extendResourcesFromExtensions` have run, via `_beginSessionStartSettlement`) and then calls `buildPromptCachePrefixRequest` with the agent, extension runner, model runtime, effective service tier, and base prompt/options.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/prompt-cache-prefix-request.ts` (new, fork-only): `buildPromptCachePrefixRequest` composes the system prompt with `emitBeforeAgentStart("", undefined, base, options, { preview: true })` (a second pass when the base prompt changed during the first), builds the tools through agent-core `buildProviderContext` from `agent.state.tools`/`declaredTools` (the same declared list and `activeToolNames` subset the loop sends on allowed-tools models), mirrors `Agent.createLoopConfig()` for reasoning (configuration-update baseline, then thinking level), thinking selection/budgets, session id, and `onPayload`, applies `before_provider_headers`, and resolves auth/headers/`extraBody`/upstream model id through `ModelRuntime.prepareSimpleRequest`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: new public `prepareSimpleRequest(model, options)` returns the `prepareRequest` result with `withPayloadRequestMetadata`, the same preparation `streamSimple` applies on the single-credential path, without sending a request.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/usage-totals.ts`: `getUsageCostBreakdown` counts the same entries in the `Tools/summaries` bucket, so the breakdown and the totals agree.

### Why

The `cache-keepalive` builtin now issues one OpenAI GPT-5.6+ prompt-cache prewarm per session start. The request is billed at the cache-write rate but produces no assistant message, so without the stats change the session totals under-report what was billed.

The first version of the prewarm sent `ctx.getSystemPrompt()` from inside its own `session_start` handler. Live QA (gpt-6-luna, real API) showed the prewarm writing 12,242 tokens while the first turn read 0 and wrote 18,444: that prompt was taken before later extensions finished `session_start`, before resource discovery added skills to the base prompt, and without the per-turn `before_agent_start` additions. OpenAI reuses a prefix only up to a block boundary, so a shorter developer message is never read. The prefix now comes from the same state the first turn reads, after session start has settled.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Session stats and the cost breakdown are computed in core from session entries; there is no hook to contribute usage from a custom entry. The turn's composed system prompt, tool list, loop reasoning, and provider auth/`extraBody` resolution live in `AgentSession`, `Agent`, and `ModelRuntime`, and the end of session-start resource discovery has no event an extension can await.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the builtin import block, the `_sessionStartEvent` field block, `bindExtensions` (settlement handle and its `finally`), the reload `session_start` block, the context-action object after `getSystemPromptOptions`, and the entry loop at the top of `getSessionStats` in `agent-session.ts`.
- LOW: the new `prepareSimpleRequest` method before `completeSimple` in `model-runtime.ts`.
- LOW: the import block and the `branch_summary`/`compaction` branch of `getUsageCostBreakdown` in `usage-totals.ts`.

## 2026-09-24 - Keep tool declarations and the prompt tool section stable on allowed_tools models (senpi#2095)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the session records every tool that has been active (`_declaredToolNames`, first-activation order). On a model whose compat sets `supportsAllowedTools`, `setActiveToolsByName` publishes that declared set as `agent.state.declaredTools` (only when it differs from the active list) and builds the base system prompt, including `selectedTools` for prompt presets, from it, so a tool removing itself (ask-user) or being toggled (gpt-apply-patch, tool-search promotion, MCP active set, eval-only filtering) no longer changes the tools or the prompt tool section; the active subset reaches the provider as `allowed_tools`. Models without the flag keep the active list as tools and prompt section. `_refreshToolDeclarationsForModel` re-derives the declaration before `before_agent_start` (both prompt paths) and in the next-turn snapshot, rebuilding the prompt only when a model switch moves its tool list; the snapshot carries `declaredTools`. The resources-discover prompt rebuild uses the same tool list.

### Why

Every mid-session tool-set change rewrote both the provider `tools` list and the prompt's "Available Tools" section, so the next GPT-5.6+ request missed the whole cached prefix.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The active tool list, the base system prompt and the next-turn context snapshot are owned by `AgentSession`; extensions only call `setActiveTools`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: the tail of `setActiveToolsByName` and the new private helpers after it; the start of `_rebuildSystemPrompt`.
- LOW: the next-turn snapshot return in the `prepareNextTurnWithContext` wrapper, the two `emitBeforeAgentStart` call sites, `extendResourcesFromExtensions`, the private field block, and the `@earendil-works/pi-ai` import.

## 2026-09-24 - Fast /resume listing: chunked summary reader and persistent summary index (senpi#2087)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-summary.ts`: `readSessionSummary` reads through `readFileLines`, a 1 MiB reused-buffer async reader that splits on LF only and drops a trailing CR, instead of `readline`. Summaries are unchanged except that records containing raw U+2028/U+2029 (valid inside JSON strings) are no longer split and dropped; they now count exactly as `loadEntriesFromFile` loads them.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-summary-index-file.ts` (new): the on-disk format of `<sessions-dir>/.session-summaries.index` - a `{"version":1}` header, then one `{file,size,mtimeMs,summary}` JSON line per session; tolerant loading (missing or foreign header discards the file, unparsable lines are skipped, last line wins), whole-line appends that first close a torn tail, and atomic rewrite through a temp file plus `rename`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-summary-index.ts` (new): `SessionSummaryIndex`, the per-directory second cache level. It loads lazily on the first in-memory miss it can serve (a per-process snapshot of entry stamps, trusted only while the index file's size and mtime are unchanged, skips the load for a changed or never-indexed file), appends summaries it lacks after a listing, and rewrites the file when it is unusable or its entry bytes exceed twice the live bytes. Live entries are capped at 256 MiB, keeping the most recently active sessions; entries for removed files are dropped on rewrite. Every index failure is swallowed and the listing streams instead.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-summary-cache.ts`: `readCachedSessionSummary(filePath, store?)` consults an optional `SessionSummaryStore` on an LRU miss before streaming, and records every served summary into it; `sessionSummaryStreamCount()` test seam; `clearSessionSummaryCache()` also forgets index snapshots.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-discovery.ts`: `buildSessionInfo` / `listSessionInfos` pass the store through; new `listSessionFilesInDir(dir, files, onLoaded)` lists one directory through its index and persists it; `listSessionsFromDir` uses it.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `listAll()` lists each project directory through `listSessionFilesInDir` in turn (so each directory's index is used and updated) with the same `(loaded, total)` grand-total progress.

### Why

- A cold process re-streamed every session file to list `/resume` rows: 5.6-27 s for a 1,089-session, ~2.5 GB directory, dominated by `readline`'s per-line async iteration. With a warm index the same cold listing reads one ~49 MB file.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session listing, the summary cache, and `SessionManager.list` / `listAll` are core session internals with no extension hook.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the import line and the per-directory loop in `SessionManager.listAll` in `session-manager.ts`; the other files are fork-owned.

## 2026-09-24 - Profile /resume session switches under TIMING (senpi#2087)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/timings.ts`: adds the `switch` namespace to `TimingLabel`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`: `switchSession` resets the `switch` namespace and marks `beforeSwitch`, `open`, `apply`, and `rebind`; `teardownCurrent` marks `abort`, `shutdown`, and `dispose` when the reason is `resume`. Every mark is a no-op unless `TIMING=1` (brand or legacy prefix), exactly like the existing `reload` namespace.

### Why

- Resuming a 42.5 MB / 8,201-message session took 2-4 s from Enter to "Resumed session" with no way to see where the time went. The marks showed the switch has no single avoidable phase: the wall time is ~40 serial `session_start` handlers (~0.8 s self time) interleaved with the deferred transcript hydration (~0.65 s in 11 chunks), plus open/services/session construction/render at ~0.1 s each. `test/suite/switch-timings.test.ts` pins the runtime-owned mark sequence the same way `reload-timings.test.ts` pins the reload one.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The phases are runtime internals (`SessionManager.open`, teardown, factory, rebind) that run before any extension of the new session is bound.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `TimingLabel` union in `timings.ts`; the import block, `switchSession`, and `teardownCurrent` in `agent-session-runtime.ts`.

## 2026-09-24 - configuration_update follows a catalog capability flag (senpi#2094)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the three `gpt-6-astra` + `openai`/`chatgpt-subscription` checks read `supportsConfigurationUpdate(model)` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` instead: the model-switch reset of `reasoningBaseline`, the thinking-level change that appends a `configuration_update` entry, and the post-compaction re-append of the latest effort.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/issue-2094-configuration-update-capability.test.ts`: faux-provider coverage of all three paths for a flagged and an unflagged model.

### Why

Every model the catalog flags keeps its prompt cache across thinking-level changes; before this only gpt-6-astra did, and every other GPT-5.6/GPT-6 row re-sent the whole prefix uncached after an effort change.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The session entry stream, `reasoningBaseline`, and the compaction commit are owned by `AgentSession`; no extension hook can append a session entry inside `setThinkingLevel` or between the compaction entry and the rebuilt context.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `@earendil-works/pi-ai` value import block, the `reasoningBaseline` reset in the model-switch path, the `appendConfigurationUpdate` block in `setThinkingLevel`, and the `latestConfigurationEffort` re-append after `appendCompaction`.

## 2026-09-24 - Environment context (cwd + date) moves from the system prompt into an append-only message (senpi#2093)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/environment-context.ts` (new, fork-only): `ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT_MESSAGE_TYPE` (`environment-context`), `resolveEnvironmentContext` (cwd with `/` separators, UTC `YYYY-MM-DD` date), `formatEnvironmentContext` (`<environment_context>` with `<cwd>` and `<current_date>`), `latestEnvironmentContext`, and `environmentContextMessageIfChanged`, which returns a hidden (`display: false`) custom message only when the cwd or date differs from the latest one in the given messages.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `prompt()` puts that message ahead of the user message when it is due, and a `sendCustomMessage(..., { triggerTurn: true })` turn puts it ahead of the triggering message. It persists through the normal `message_end` custom-message path and `convertToLlm` sends it as a user-role message, so every provider adapter and task child sees it without adapter changes. Because the check reads the current agent state, the first turn after a compaction that summarized the message away re-appends the latest value; nothing is written at compaction time, so the compacted context tail (which post-compaction continuation logic inspects) is unchanged. Earlier entries are never rewritten. `AgentSessionConfig.environmentContext` (default `true`) gates injection; the faux test harness (`test/suite/harness.ts`) passes `false` unless a test opts in, so mechanics tests that pin exact transcripts stay exact.

### Why

- The generated system prompt ended in `Current date:` / `Current working directory:` lines, with extension appends after them. A new day, another directory, or a session crossing UTC midnight rewrote the provider-visible prefix, and OpenAI, Anthropic and the other prefix-cache providers re-read the whole system prompt uncached. Live probes on 2026-09-24 read 0 cached tokens after a date change inside the prompt, and 4877 of about 4900 cached in another session on another day once the values moved into an environment-context user message. An append-only rollover kept 4918 of 4973 cached. Codex sends cwd/date the same way.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The message must precede the user message inside `AgentSession`'s prompt assembly; `before_agent_start` messages are pushed after the user message, and the trigger-turn branch of `sendCustomMessage` builds its request array internally.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the messages-array head in `prompt()` and the `const messages: AgentMessage[] = [appMessage]` line of the `sendCustomMessage` trigger-turn branch.
- LOW: one `AgentSessionConfig` field, one private field and its constructor assignment, and one import line.

## 2026-09-23 - Streaming tool-call events name the tool a call resolves to (senpi#2068)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tool-call-display-name.ts` (new): `SessionMessageUpdateEvent` (`message_update` plus optional `resolvedToolName`) and `withResolvedToolName`, which reads the streamed name of a `toolcall_start` (its `partial` block) or `toolcall_end` (its `toolCall`) and attaches the resolved one. Other `message_update` records pass through untouched.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `AgentSessionEvent`'s `message_update` member is `SessionMessageUpdateEvent`; the listener emit point annotates through `resolveToolCallName` (senpi#2064), the same rule and callable-name set the agent loop uses. Extension events are unchanged.

### Why

- RPC clients (the desktop app) render a call from the streamed events and only learned the resolved name at `tool_execution_start`, so a `mcp__<id>__Edit` call showed that name until execution began. A client cannot resolve it itself: the rule needs the session's callable names, and a real tool may be named `mcp__server__tool`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Listener events are emitted by the session; an extension cannot add a field to the RPC record stream.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `AgentSessionEvent` union head and the `this._emit(...)` line after extension dispatch in `_processAgentEvent`.

## 2026-09-23 - Expose the session's tool-call name resolution for display (senpi#2064)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: public `resolveToolCallName(requested)` returns the tool a call named `requested` runs, by the same `resolveToolNameAlias` rule over `_callableToolNames` that `resolveUnknownToolCall` uses, without activating anything; unresolved names come back unchanged.

### Why

- The TUI builds a tool card from the streamed assistant `toolCall.name` before execution starts. It needs the agent's own answer to render a gateway-namespaced or recased call as the resolved tool from its first frame.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The callable-name set (active, lazily activatable, and `tool_search` catalog names) is private session state.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: one method after `getToolDefinition` in `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-23 - Settings overrides survive saves and reloads (senpi#2052)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `applyOverrides` merges into a private, never-persisted `runtimeOverrides` layer, and every recompute (`save`, `saveProjectSettings`, `reload`, `setProjectTrusted`) goes through `mergedSettings()` = global, then project, then that layer. `markModified` / `markProjectModified` drop the override for exactly the key an explicit setter writes.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-overrides.ts` (new): `withoutOverride` removes one field or one nested key from the layer without mutating it.

### Why

- An override lived only in the resolved view, so the first save of anything (the thinking level, for example) or a reload rebuilt that view from disk and dropped it. `--no-model-fallback` / `SENPI_NO_FALLBACK=1` therefore stopped working mid-session and a Claude version-floor 400 walked the whole fallback chain (oh-my-openagent#8700); `--no-ask-user`, `--theme` and SDK `applyOverrides` callers had the same hole.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Overrides are the settings manager's own state; an extension can only read the resolved settings the manager hands out.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `applyOverrides`, the recompute call sites, `markModified` / `markProjectModified`, and the private field list in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`.

## 2026-09-23 - Migrate legacy provider ids in models.json on disk (senpi#2044)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/models-json-migration.ts` (new): `migrateModelsJsonProviderIds` rewrites a models.json whose `providers` keys or `disabledProviders` entries use a legacy provider id (`openai-codex`, `claude-sdk-oauth`) to the canonical id, once. It edits only the affected JSONC tokens so comments and formatting survive, proves the result re-parses to the migrated document (falling back to a full re-serialization only when it does not), drops a legacy entry shadowed by its canonical entry, keeps the original bytes as `models.json.backup-<stamp>`, writes through a temp file with the original mode, refuses to replace a file that changed after it was read, and removes its temp and backup on any failure.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts`: `load` and `loadSync` run the migration after a successful parse (`parseAndMigrate`); the in-memory read boundary is unchanged. The per-launch "models.json uses renamed provider ids" warning is gone; a warning remains only when the rewrite fails, and it names the reason. The pre-validation normalization loop in `parse` now skips non-array `models`, non-object `modelOverrides` and non-object entries, so a shape error such as `"models": "x"` is reported by the schema validator as `Invalid models.json schema` instead of crashing with `(record.models ?? []).map is not a function`.
- Tests: `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/issue-2044-models-json-provider-id-migration.test.ts`; `packages/coding-agent/test/read-boundary-models-json.test.ts` now expects no warning for a migrated file; `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/no-sync-in-session-path.ledger.json` records the migration's one-shot, KB-scale sync read and two writes on the session path.

### Why

The read boundary added for senpi#1989 normalized legacy ids in memory but never rewrote models.json, so every launch repeated the warning and each user had to hand-edit the file. auth.json, settings.json and the account directory were already migrated in place; models.json was the last persisted surface left read-only. This reverses the "Nothing here rewrites state" stance of the 2026-09-22 read-boundary entry for models.json only.

### Why an extension could not handle it

`ModelConfig` loads models.json inside the model runtime before any extension binds, and the file path is owned by core.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `parse`/`load`/`loadSync` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts` and its import list.

## 2026-09-23 — Observe stderr below hidden diagnostic redirects (senpi#1879)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/output-guard.ts` exposes a shared visible-stderr subscription. It follows the underlying writer across guard installation and restoration, retaining callback and backpressure behavior.

### Why

- Hidden diagnostics were invalidating mouse geometry even though no bytes reached the terminal.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The output guard owns the actual stderr destination and its redacted failure fallback.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- Stderr takeover and restoration. Multiple subscribers and both teardown orders must remain safe.

## 2026-09-23 - Legacy Cursor variant references resolve through runtime-derived groups (senpi#2038)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: `resolveLegacyCursorReference`, `resolveStoredModelReference`, and `cursorLegacyAliasesForModel` additionally resolve Cursor ids the static alias table does not list through `compat.cursorReasoning.variantIds` - the variant ids the pi-ai runtime derivation observed for the identity. A reverse lookup through those ids yields the thinking level; it is case-insensitive like `findExactModelReferenceMatch` (which resolved these ids before grouping) and forwards the catalog spelling as `legacyVariantId`, because the selection descriptor allowlists exact ids, so `cursor/grok-4.7-xhigh`, a stored `grok-4.7-medium`, and the `cursor/grok-4.7-*` glob projection all resolve onto the derived `grok-4.7` identity with a `{ source: "legacy-variant" }` selection instead of falling through to fuzzy matches or `undefined`. Static-table behavior is untouched: the static alias branch runs first and is unchanged, `-fast` variants never appear in `variantIds` and stay flat, and the direct `getModel` fallback still wins for stored flat ids.
- The reverse lookup accepts the actual registered API ids for both providers (`cursor`/`cursor-agent` and `cursor-cli-oauth`/`cursor-cli-oauth`). Unique exact models take precedence over derived (but not static) aliases in `resolveLegacyCursorReference`, `parseModelPattern`, and stored restore, including unqualified references to other providers.
- Tests: `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/2038-cursor-derived-variants.test.ts` builds the catalog over `packages/ai/test/fixtures/cursor-usable-models-unlisted-20260923.json` and pins legacy variant, explicit level, stored reference, flat fast id, glob projection, both provider/API pairs, and exact-match precedence; `2038-cursor-derived-reference-boundaries.test.ts` pins mixed-case references and the static-alias-key boundary in both lanes.

### Why

- Cursor ships suffix variant ids (grok-4.7-low/-medium/-high/-xhigh) that the frozen 2026-08-18 alias table cannot know. pi-ai now derives those groups at catalog time (senpi#2038), but the resolver consulted only the static table, so a legacy reference either fuzzy-matched a flat `-fast` model (`cursor/grok-4.7:low` landed on `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` with thinking off) or resolved to `undefined` on restore. The resolver is the only layer that maps a user-typed or stored id onto a scoped model with a thinking selection. The first reverse lookup also excluded the CLI lane's registered API and displaced exact raw models; both defects are fixed without changing static alias precedence.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `parseModelPattern`, `resolveStoredModelReference`, and the glob projection run inside core model selection before extensions bind; an extension can register providers but cannot change how the resolver maps patterns and stored ids onto models.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: the cursor helper block after `legacySelection` (`derivedCursorVariantIds` / `derivedCursorVariantMatch` / `derivedResolution` / `cursorLegacySelection`), the body of `resolveLegacyCursorReference` (exact-match gate), the derived branch of `resolveStoredModelReference` (direct-model gate), the tail of `cursorLegacyAliasesForModel`, `resolveDerivedCursorVariant`, and the alias-projection line in `resolveModelScopeFromModels`; the `@earendil-works/pi-ai` import list.

## 2026-09-23 - Namespaced calls to deferred tools activate the unique match (senpi#2025)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `resolveUnknownToolCall` resolves the requested name through `resolveToolNameAlias` against every callable name - active tools, registered search-exposed tools that allow lazy activation, and the `tool_search` catalog when one is bound - then activates the match through `_activateLazyTool`. The candidates come from `_callableToolNames`; a missing tool-search runtime now contributes no catalog names instead of disabling the resolver.

### Why

- A deferred tool is not in the request's tools, so no provider-side mapping knows it; the session is the only layer that sees the deferred catalog. The resolver used an exact catalog match only, so `mcp__686f__team_create` failed while `team_create` activated.
- The search-exposed registry is the same set `_activateLazyTool` already promotes when no catalog service is loaded, so a session without a bound tool-search runtime resolves the same names. The `allowLazyActivation` hard stop still applies because such tools are never candidates and `_activateLazyTool` re-checks it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `resolveUnknownToolCall` is session-owned agent configuration installed before extensions bind; tool-search can activate a name but cannot see calls the loop rejected.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `resolveUnknownToolCall` assignment in `_installAgentToolHooks` and the two private helpers added above `_activateLazyTool` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`; the `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core` import list.

## 2026-09-23 - GPT-6 Sol becomes the recommended and default OpenAI model

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/recommended-models/index.ts`: `RECOMMENDED_DEFAULT_MODELS` gains `["gpt-6-sol", "medium"]` directly after `["gpt-6-astra", "high"]` and ahead of `["gpt-5.6-sol", "medium"]`, so an implicit OpenAI default lands on GPT-6 Sol when Astra is not authenticated and GPT-5.6 Sol stays the next rung.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: `defaultModelPerProvider.openai` and `["chatgpt-subscription"]` move from `gpt-5.6-sol` to `gpt-6-sol`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/high-reasoning-warning.ts`: `SENSITIVE_MODEL_ID_PATTERN` adds `gpt-6-sol` beside the GPT-5.x Sol and Astra markers; the level rule is unchanged (Sol tiers warn at `xhigh` and `max`, Astra only at `max`), and GPT-6 Luna is deliberately not matched.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/tips/catalog/ethos-tips.ts`: the ulw-loop tip now names `gpt-6-sol fast/medium`.
- Tests: `test/suite/recommended-models-extension.test.ts` (ladder order and the off-list → gpt-6-sol switch), `test/model-resolver.test.ts` (provider defaults), `test/high-reasoning-warning.test.ts` (Sol id shapes warn at xhigh/max, Luna and near-miss ids do not).

### Why

GPT-6 Sol is the GPT-6 tier OpenAI positions for coding and agentic work at Sol pricing; with its catalog rows landing in this release the user asked for it to sit in the favorable/defaultable set beside Opus, Fable and Astra. The shipped Fable 5.1 fallback ladder already leads with `claude-opus-5-5:max` (2026-09-22), so no retry-fallback change was needed.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Provider defaults and the recommendation ladder are read by the resolver and the builtin before user extensions bind; a user can override them through `defaultModel` / `recommendedModels` but cannot change what ships.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: the `defaultModelPerProvider` table.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/recommended-models/index.ts`: `RECOMMENDED_DEFAULT_MODELS`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/high-reasoning-warning.ts`: the two id patterns at the top.

## 2026-09-22 - Claude Opus 5.5 leads the shipped fallback ladders

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/settings.ts`: `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_CHAINS["claude-fable-5-1"]` and `["claude-fable-5"]` become `["claude-opus-5-5:max", "claude-opus-5:max", "claude-opus-4-8:max", "claude-opus-4-6:max"]`, and a new `"claude-opus-5-5"` key ships `["claude-opus-5:max", "claude-opus-4-8:max", "claude-opus-4-6:max"]`. Every rung stays `:max` (Opus 5.5 is recommended at max; `claude-opus-4-6` publishes only that level).
- `test/settings-manager-retry-fallback.test.ts` and `test/suite/retry-fallback-chains.test.ts` re-pin the ladders and the shipped key set.

### Why

- Claude Opus 5.5 is the recommended Opus as of 2026-09-22 and runs at `max` wherever Opus 5 ran at `xhigh`. A Fable session that falls back should step down onto it first; an Opus 5.5 session needs its own same-family ladder so a refusal or a 429 does not end the turn with `no_chain`.
- The ladder still never leaves the Anthropic Opus family (senpi#1860 rationale unchanged).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Chain resolution runs inside `settings-manager.ts` -> `resolveRetryFallbackSettings` before any extension is bound; no hook contributes fallback chains.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_CHAINS` literal in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/settings.ts`.

## 2026-09-22 - normalize legacy provider ids at core read boundaries (senpi#1989)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`: every provider-keyed credential read (`read`, `get`, `getProviderEnv`, slot listing, and the standalone `readStoredCredential`) tries the canonical key and then the legacy spelling.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `getProviderConcurrencyLimit` reads `Settings.providers` through the same fallback; `migrateSettings` does not rewrite that block.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: all three model-restore paths (explicit `model_change`, the fallback window's `originalProvider`, the assistant-message echo) normalize on read, as does the explicit-selection comparison.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-accounts.ts`: the three subscription-lane comparisons compare normalized ids.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/env-slots.ts`: `primaryEnvVar` compares normalized; `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is a frozen env-var name and is unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts`: `models.json` overlay keys and `disabledProviders` are normalized on read, an explicit canonical entry wins over a legacy one, and the config carries non-fatal warnings with exactly ONE naming every id that moved.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: `recomposeProvider` composes under the canonical id, and `getWarnings` surfaces the models.json notices.

### Why

A user upgrading across the rename has the LEGACY provider id written into auth.json, settings.json, models.json and their session files. Without these read boundaries each one detaches silently: credentials report the lane logged out, a configured `maxConcurrency` stops applying, a models.json overlay stops attaching, and an old session resumes on an unknown provider. Nothing here rewrites state - these are read-side fallbacks only.

### Why an extension could not handle it

All of these run inside core credential, settings, session and model-runtime plumbing, before and beneath the extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts` accessor bodies.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` the model-restore branches in `getSessionContextSettings`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts` the `parse` provider loop and the constructor signature (a warnings argument was added).

## 2026-09-22 - reject a typed legacy provider id (senpi#1989)

### What changed


### Why

Today a typed legacy id in `/login` falls through to `showLoginProviderSelector(undefined, providerRef)`, which opens a selector filtered to nothing - it reads as "this provider vanished" rather than "it was renamed". `--provider` would fail later with a generic message. Both now name the new id so the user can retype it. Config read from disk is normalized instead (todo 8) and never hard-errored.

### Why an extension could not handle it

CLI parsing and the interactive login command are core surfaces that run before and outside the extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones



## 2026-09-22 - A caller-chosen session id is written to disk at open (#2010)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: in `_setSessionFile`'s missing-file branch, when `NewSessionOptions.id` is present the header is written immediately (`_rewriteFile()`, `flushed = true`) instead of waiting for the first assistant message.

### Why

- Deferring the file until an assistant message exists is the right default for a HOST-minted id: nothing references it yet. It is the wrong default for a CALLER-chosen id, which the caller already holds in its own records. Without this, a create under a chosen id followed by a close before the first reply left no file, and a reopen of that path minted a different identity - the id the caller stored pointed at nothing. Measured on the real host before the fix: reopen returned a fresh uuidv7 and `existsSync(path)` was false.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session identity and its first persistence happen inside `SessionManager` before any extension is bound to the session.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The `else` branch of `_setSessionFile` that handles a not-yet-existing path.
## 2026-09-22 - settings.json provider-key migration (senpi#1989)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `migrateSettings` now rewrites every provider-keyed settings field from the legacy subscription ids to the canonical ones on first parse - the settings block key (`claudeSdkOauthProvider` -> `anthropicSubscriptionProvider`, `chatgptSubscriptionProvider` -> `chatgptSubscriptionProvider`), `defaultProvider`, the provider prefix of `defaultModel`, every `favoriteModels` entry, the `${provider}/${id}` keys of `modelThinkingLevels`/`modelServiceTiers`/`modelLastOnThinkingLevels`, and every `retry.fallbackChains` key plus the providers named inside each rung. Driven by the shared `normalizeProviderId`/`normalizeModelRef` helpers so no second map drifts.

### Why

Existing users have the old subscription ids written into settings.json (defaultProvider, defaultModel, favourites, the per-model thinking/tier maps, fallback chains). After the provider rename an un-migrated settings file would silently lose those preferences - the planner would not find the renamed provider and would fall closed. The migration is idempotent (`normalize` is a no-op on canonical ids) and never hard-errors: an unrecognised shape is left untouched. The legacy settings-block key is still READ for at least two releases.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Settings are parsed and migrated inside SettingsManager before any extension loads; the provider-lane extensions read their block through `getGlobalSettings()`/`getProjectSettings()`, so the rename must happen at the migration seam, not in an extension.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` `migrateSettings`, against any other settings migration added to the same hook.

## 2026-09-22 - claude-sdk-oauth provider id renamed to anthropic-subscription in core resolution, accounts and fallback precedence (senpi#1989)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/expansion.ts`: `PROVIDER_PRECEDENCE` is `["anthropic-subscription", "anthropic", "kimi-coding"]` — the subscription lane holds the SAME rung (first) `claude-sdk-oauth` held. A pure string swap would have dropped it from the ordered table, and absent providers sort alphabetically last, demoting the subscription lane behind the metered `anthropic` API-key lane (reproduced as omo #8051/#8059). Order is preserved, not just membership.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/settings.ts`: comment names the lane by its new display name.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-accounts.ts`: the three provider-key comparisons (`===`/`!==`) use `"anthropic-subscription"`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/env-slots.ts`: the provider comparison moves to the new id; the returned `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` env name is unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-display-names.ts`: `"anthropic-subscription": "Anthropic Subscription"` added beside `anthropic`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: comment names the SDK-owned lane by its new id.

### Why

The id named an SDK integration detail rather than the thing a user signs in with. The wire api id `claude-sdk-oauth` and every persisted token (managed sentinel, compact entry type, compact-boundary diagnostic + schema, binding sidecar, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN*` env vars, `claude_sdk_oauth_*` diagnostics) are deliberately NOT renamed — renaming any of them orphans data on existing installs. The precedence table is the one place a naive rename would have shipped a silent ordering regression, so it is pinned by `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/anthropic-subscription-rename.test.ts`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

`PROVIDER_PRECEDENCE` is a module-private table inside `core/retry-fallback/expansion.ts`, and the credential-account/env-slot comparisons run inside core credential plumbing before extension hooks see the provider key. The display-name map is core-owned (`BUILT_IN_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAMES`).

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/expansion.ts` `PROVIDER_PRECEDENCE`, against any tie-break change.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-display-names.ts`, against any other provider addition.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-accounts.ts` provider comparisons, against pooled-account changes.

## 2026-09-22 - auth.json provider-key migration (senpi#1989)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-provider-key-migration.ts` (new): `migrateLegacyProviderKeys` rewrites an auth.json credential stored under a legacy provider id to its canonical id, driven by `LEGACY_PROVIDER_IDS` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai`. Completion is derived from the data (a no-op once the legacy key is absent), not a migrations-state marker, so a load that skips the migration because the store is locked retries next time and an older binary re-introducing a legacy key still gets migrated.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`: the migration runs on the existing `parseStorageContent` write-back-once seam under the store lock, and the credential write became temp-file + rename at `0o600` with a timestamped backup taken from the original bytes.

### Why

Two subscription provider ids are being renamed (senpi#1989). Existing users have the old ids written into auth.json, so a load after the upgrade must rewrite the credential under the canonical key exactly once while keeping the user logged in. The managed sentinel is DERIVED from the provider id (`${providerId}-managed`), so `packages/ai/src/auth/pool/slots.ts` was widened to accept the legacy-derived material too - otherwise a pooled user's slots, which keep their sentinel values verbatim, become unauthenticatable and invisible.

### Why an extension could not handle it

auth.json is read and repaired inside the package before any extension loads; the pool sentinel check and the credential store are core, so an extension cannot migrate a key the store has already read under the old spelling.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`, against any other change to the credential load/parse seam.
## 2026-09-22 - chatgpt-subscription provider id in core resolution and display (senpi#1989)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: provider-id comparisons and default-model selection use the new id.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-display-names.ts`: the built-in display map is keyed by the new id and renders "ChatGPT Subscription".
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: session-level provider checks use the new id.

### Why

The OpenAI subscription provider id was renamed from `openai-codex` to `chatgpt-subscription` (senpi#1989): the old id named a CLI rather than the thing a user signs in with. These modules resolve or display that provider id at runtime, so they move with it. The wire api id `openai-codex-responses` is deliberately NOT renamed - it names the dialect, not the provider - and neither are file names or module paths.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The provider id is resolved inside the package before any extension loads, and these call sites compare or render it while building requests and UI. An extension cannot rewrite an id the package has already used.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-display-names.ts`, against any other provider label change.

# changes

## 2026-09-22 - xAI provider default moves to grok-4.7 (senpi#1990)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: `defaultModelPerProvider.xai` moves from `grok-4.5` to `grok-4.7`, porting upstream pi-mono 1a584a7a56 (`feat(ai,coding-agent): add Grok 4.7 support`) onto the fork's resolver, which still defaulted two versions behind. `test/model-resolver.test.ts` realigns with it: the xai-default assertion and the initial-selection fixture's synthetic xai model (`custom` + `defaultModelId`), because the provider-default branch resolves `defaultModelPerProvider.xai` against the runtime catalog and a `grok-4.5` fixture fell through to `first-available`.

### Why

- The catalog gained `xai/grok-4.7` (packages/ai shard regeneration in the same PR); the provider default tracks the current model.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The provider default is core model-resolution state read during initial selection, before extension hooks can influence it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The `defaultModelPerProvider` xai entry on upstream syncs that also move the default.

## 2026-09-22 - SessionManager.open can create under a caller-chosen id (senpi#1951)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `static open(path, sessionDir?, cwdOverride?, options?)` now accepts `NewSessionOptions`, and the private constructor forwards them into `_setSessionFile`, which applies them at BOTH `_resetToNewSession` call sites: the branch where the path does not exist yet and the branch where the file exists but is empty. Opening an existing, non-empty session file reaches neither branch, so the header's id stays authoritative exactly as before. `SessionManager.create` already took the same options; this closes the asymmetry between the two constructors.

### Why

- The RPC host gained `open_session.durableSessionId`, which lets a caller that already owns a stable record id for the conversation create the session under that id instead of maintaining a second identity and a mapping. That value has to reach `_resetToNewSession`, and for the callers that matter it could not: a client naming its own session file always lands in `open`, not `create`, and with a not-yet-existing path `_setSessionFile` fell through to `_resetToNewSession()` with no options and minted a fresh uuidv7. The supplied id would have been silently dropped on precisely the path every real embedder uses.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session identity is assigned inside `SessionManager` before any extension is loaded for that session, and the id is written into the JSONL header the first flush persists. No extension hook runs early enough to influence it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `static open`'s parameter list and its `new SessionManager(...)` call, which previously passed `undefined` in the options slot.
- The private constructor's `_setSessionFile(sessionFile, preloadedFileEntries)` call.
- The `_setSessionFile` signature and its two `_resetToNewSession` call sites; upstream changes to the empty-file recovery branch land in the same lines.

## 2026-09-21 - A WebSocket drop inside a credential pool no longer kills the turn (senpi#1628)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/failover.ts`: `runCredentialFailover` guards one thing - the integrity of the single event stream the caller consumes - and no longer decides whether the turn may be replayed. After committed output it yields the provider's own terminal `error` event unchanged (partial content, usage, `provider_transport_failure` diagnostics intact) instead of throwing a synthesized error, and it never stamps `senpi:no-turn-retry:`. `CredentialFailoverError` is thrown only when an attempt threw with no event to forward and no slot is left; its message is the provider's text (the `suppressTurnRetry` option and field are gone). New `isStreamStart` option: once a start frame reached the caller, a replacement attempt's duplicate start is dropped so `agent-loop` keeps one message per stream.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/rotation-events.ts` (new): `isCommittedRotationOutput` treats `start`, `text_start`, `thinking_start` and `toolcall_start` as pre-commit bookkeeping (default-DENY for everything else), `isRotationStreamStart`, `rotationErrorFromEvent`. `rotation-stream.ts` wires them.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/classify.ts`: abnormal WebSocket closure (1006/1001/1011-1014), the runtime's bare `WebSocket error`, and the connect/liveness watchdog verdicts classify as `retry_same`; 1008 and 1009 stay `fail_request`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` `_terminalFailureText`, `modes/print-mode.ts`, `modes/interactive/components/assistant-render-descriptors.ts`: render through pi-ai's `describeProviderFailureForUser` (stall wording delegated, WebSocket interruptions worded for a person) and strip the marker from the raw fallback text. `extensions/builtin/compaction/deterministic-fallback.ts` re-exports pi-ai's `stripTurnRetrySuppressionPrefix` instead of owning a copy; `TURN_RETRY_SUPPRESSION_PREFIX` itself now lives in `packages/ai/src/utils/provider-failure-description.ts` and `auth/pool/failover.ts` re-exports it.
- `packages/ai/src/api/websocket-transport-failure.ts` (new): a message-less `error` event defers to the `close` frame that follows (`WebSocket closed 1006 Connection ended`), bounded by a 250 ms grace; both Responses adapters use it.

### Why

- A Codex WebSocket drop in a multi-account pool ended the turn with `senpi:no-turn-retry:WebSocket error` and an empty assistant message. The runner rethrew after any event past `start` (a bare `thinking_start` already counted as committed), `lazyStream` turned the throw into a fresh message with no content or diagnostics, and the marker disabled both the same-model retry and the fallback chain that a single-key provider gets for the identical fault. A mid-stream stall with partial output IS retried by the session engine, so the marker made a transport drop strictly worse than a stall. In the plain streaming lanes no tool runs before the message completes, so the only thing in-lane rotation must protect is stream integrity; the Claude SDK lane, where tools execute mid-stream, keeps its own marker.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The rotation runner, the retry predicates on `AgentSession`, and the transcript/print renderers are core; an extension sees the finished assistant message only after the marker has already suppressed recovery.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/failover.ts`: the attempt loop and the `CredentialFailoverError` constructor.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the pi-ai import block and `_terminalFailureText`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/components/assistant-render-descriptors.ts`: the `error` branch of the stop-reason switch.

## 2026-09-21 - Bun keeps its native fetch across HTTP dispatcher setup (#1890)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/http-dispatcher.ts`: the global-install decision is the pure, injectable `shouldInstallUndiciGlobals({ versions, currentFetch, originalFetch, installedFetch })`. It answers `false` whenever `versions.bun` is set; the Node branch keeps the existing override-preservation rule. `configureHttpDispatcher` still installs the `EnvHttpProxyAgent` as undici's global dispatcher on every runtime.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/1890-bun-native-fetch.test.ts` pins both branches from one runner.

### Why

- The distributed CLI inlines npm undici, so `undici.install()` used to replace Bun's native `fetch` with undici's fetch running on Bun. On Bun 1.3.x that fetch delivers the response headers and then never a streamed body: a print-mode run of the 2026.9.20 bundle against a loopback Anthropic SSE server returns `HELLO` in 0.5s on Bun 1.4.2 and hangs past 45s on Bun 1.3.14 with the request already received. Every SSE model response on that runtime stalled after the headers.
- Bun's own fetch honors `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY`, which `applyHttpProxySettings` sets, and the agent loop bounds stalled streams through `getAgentStreamIdleTimeoutMs` / `getAgentStreamStartTimeoutMs`, both derived from the same `httpIdleTimeoutMs` setting. The undici `bodyTimeout` / `headersTimeout` therefore only ever guarded Node; on Bun they had applied solely where the install worked.
- In source form `import "undici"` resolves to Bun's builtin shim, which has no `install`, so the package tests could not observe the bundle behaviour; the injected decision is the seam that can.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `configureHttpDispatcher` runs from `cli-main.ts` / `rpc-entry.ts` before any extension loads, and restoring `globalThis.fetch` afterwards would leave the other replaced constructors and the installed marker behind.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/http-dispatcher.ts`: the `shouldInstallGlobals` computation at the end of `configureHttpDispatcher` and the new exported decision above it. Dispatcher construction, proxy handling, and the multi-session pin are unchanged.

## 2026-09-21 - Typed missing-entry tree navigation refusal (#1892 follow-up)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_navigateTree` throws the existing `AssistantEditError("not-found", ...)` for a missing target, exposing the stable `not_found` code through the shared core path and RPC handler.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` threw a plain error, so RPC navigation omitted its documented `errorCode`. Real handler regressions cover both `entryId` and `targetId`, with no changes to the leaf, entries, messages, or session file on refusal.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` validates the target before dispatching extension tree events; the core error must carry the code for every caller.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the missing-target guard in `_navigateTree`. Selection, guard ordering, summaries, and edit behavior are unchanged.

## 2026-09-21 - Exact-leaf navigation intent (#1926)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `TreeNavigationOptions.intent` adds `select | resume`. `_navigateTree` keeps retry selection as default and handles exact resumption in its existing target-position branch, suppressing editor text for every target role. Shared summary/label generation still records metadata, then restores the requested resume leaf before context restoration and lifecycle notification. If lifecycle handlers append further metadata, the same core navigation restores the exact leaf and context again before returning; real CLI QA exposed this builtin behavior and a real-handler regression covers it. Message replacements keep their existing behavior.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: a branch ending in an edited user message needs resumption on that prompt, not selection of its parent for retry. Exact leaf identity also excludes newly generated summary/label metadata from the active tail; summaries remain in the tree and response, outside resumed context.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: leaf selection, guards, cancellation, summaries, agent-message restoration and revision bookkeeping belong to the shared core mutation. A handler/extension leaf rewrite would bypass that lifecycle and risk changing released callers.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `TreeNavigationOptions`, `_navigateTree` target positioning, post-label context restoration and post-lifecycle exact-leaf finalization. Existing selection and replacement branches remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-21 - Per-provider streaming concurrency cap (senpi#1909)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-concurrency.ts` (new): `createProviderSemaphores(getLimit)` hands out one FIFO, abort-aware semaphore per provider id and exposes `bracket(providerId, signal, run)` plus `resize(providerId, limit)`. `bracket` acquires a slot, calls `run()`, and releases exactly once when the returned stream's `result()` settles - fulfil, reject, or abort - never at stream construction. A provider with no cap returns `run()` untouched, so the unconfigured path adds no bookkeeping.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: all four provider stream call sites (`stream` and `streamSimple`, each in its credential-rotation attempt and its plain path) go through the bracket, keyed by `prepared.model.provider`; `complete`/`completeSimple` inherit it. `setSettingsManager()` (also accepted as `CreateModelRuntimeOptions.settingsManager`) supplies the limits and subscribes for changes.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `Settings.providers?: Record<string, ProviderConcurrencySettings>`, `getProviderConcurrencyLimit()`, `getProviderSettings()`, and `subscribeToProviderSettings()`. Every merged-settings assignment now routes through one `updateSettings()` helper so trust changes, reloads, overrides and saves all notify subscribers.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-diagnostics.ts`: a negative or fractional `providers.<id>.maxConcurrency` becomes a startup warning instead of silently doing nothing. One private `providerSettingsWarnings()` feeds both the plain collector and the new context-labelled `collectSettingsDiagnosticsWithContext()`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`: both session entry points hand their settings manager to the runtime.
- Behaviour is unchanged until a cap is configured; no provider ships a default.

### Why

- A provider that rate-limits on concurrent connections (or a local runtime with a small worker pool) turns burst fan-out into 429s and refused sockets, and senpi had no way to express "at most N at once" for one provider.
- The bracket is deliberately narrow. Holding a slot for a whole agent turn deadlocks any spawn tree wider than the cap, because parents wait on children that wait for slots the parents still hold. Releasing when the provider's stream finishes producing keeps the slot tied to the HTTP request and nothing else.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The request is issued inside `ModelRuntime`, after credential resolution and rotation slot selection; no extension hook sits between provider selection and the outgoing stream, and the cap must also cover rotation retries.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: the four `prepared.provider.stream(...)` / `streamSimple(...)` call sites in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts` are wrapped, so upstream edits to those argument lists conflict textually.
- LOW: additive `Settings` field, additive `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` methods, and the `this.settings = ...` assignments rerouted through `updateSettings()`.

## 2026-09-21 - Thread the host MCP registry into session resources (#1915)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts` adds an optional registry to the runtime factory input.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts` forwards the registry to the resource loader.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` constructs the MCP builtin with a fresh service using that registry. Other builtin factories retain their order and identity.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` form the explicit host-to-session injection path. No module-global registry or provider-scope lookup is needed; production connection sharing remains disabled.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The runtime factory contract in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`, service composition in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts` and builtin construction in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` are host-owned startup boundaries.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`: `CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`: options and resource-loader construction.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: options and builtin factory selection.

## 2026-09-21 - Dispatch retained attachment lifecycle (#1902)

### What changed

- `agent-session-runtime.ts` dispatches additive parked/resumed events through the current session's extension runner.

### Why

- A retained session outlives its client but optional periodic work should not.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Only the runtime owns the current runner across session replacement.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- Runtime lifecycle dispatch adjacent to `emitBeforeSwitch`; no TUI lifecycle changes.

## 2026-09-21 - Selecting the current prompt still moves to its parent

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: removed `_navigateTree`'s early return for
  `targetId === oldLeafId`, so the existing user/custom selection rule also applies to the current
  leaf. A root prompt resets the leaf to null; a nested prompt selects its parent. Both return
  editor text and run the normal cancellation, summary, lifecycle-event, and session-state path.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` previously treated selecting the latest prompt
  as a no-op. Retrying that prompt then appended it under itself, duplicating it in model context.
  The RPC regressions cover root and non-root retries through the subsequent turn, preserving the
  abandoned tree while submitting the prompt exactly once.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` returned before `session_before_tree` and before
  the shared selection/state-restoration logic. An extension or RPC-only leaf rewrite cannot repair
  that short-circuit consistently across the TUI and other callers.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_navigateTree` immediately after the expected-leaf
  guard. The existing assistant-edit and tree-selection suites pass unchanged before and after.

## 2026-09-21 - Edit a user message in place as a tree branch

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `editUserMessage(entryId, text, options)` sits beside `editAssistantMessage` and routes through the same private `_navigateTree`, so the streaming guard, the `expectedLeafId` stale check, branch summaries and the `session_before_tree` / `session_tree` events are shared rather than re-implemented. It validates a `message` entry with `role === "user"`, rejects blank text, short-circuits identical text as `{ unchanged: true }`, and otherwise moves the leaf to the target's PARENT and appends the edited prompt there as the new leaf. `_navigateTree`'s `replacement` widens from `AssistantMessage` to `AssistantMessage | UserMessage`; a replacement still suppresses `editorText`, because an edited prompt is written into the session instead of an editor. No turn starts.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/edited-user-message.ts` (new): `buildEditedUserMessage()` keeps the trimmed text and carries every non-text block over verbatim - a prompt's attachments are the user's own input, so unlike an edited assistant response nothing is dropped - plus `userTextEquals()`, `assertExpectedUserLeaf()`, and `UserEditError` with reasons `empty | not-user | not-found | stale-leaf` mapped to the wire codes `empty | not_user | not_found | stale_leaf`. Streaming refusal reuses `SessionStreamingError`.

### Why

- A client can already edit an assistant response in place; a prompt still required the interactive `/tree` selector, which only puts the text back in the editor. This gives non-interactive callers the same in-file branch semantics `docs/sessions.md` documents for selecting a user message, without `fork`/`clone` creating a second session file, and without deleting the original branch.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The guard ordering (streaming, then leaf token, then target validation) and the leaf move itself run inside the core mutation, ahead of `session_before_tree`; an extension cannot append the replacement under the target's parent.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `editAssistantMessage` / `_navigateTree` heads in `agent-session.ts` (one added method and one widened parameter type); the fork-only `edited-user-message.ts`.
- Coverage: `test/suite/tree-edit-user-message.test.ts`.

## 2026-09-20 - A fallback rung too small for the transcript is repaired, not rejected (senpi#1873)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_switchActiveModel` gained `repairWithSlice`, set by the retry-fallback lanes. When a rung reports `fits-after-compaction`, `_reduceForSwitchTarget` reduces the transcript with `planResumeSlice` against that rung's own projection and re-measures before the admission guard runs, so the chain advances onto a model that can now hold the conversation instead of rejecting it.
- `_projectPendingSwitchFit` is renamed `_projectSwitchFit`; it is now shared by the held-switch repair and the fallback repair.
- The reduction is skipped when compaction is disabled, and `planResumeSlice` returning nothing leaves the original refusal in place, so a transcript with no interior boundary to cut still fails the rung rather than advancing onto a model that cannot serve it.

### Why

- A fallback switch has no next message to defer to: the retry is the next request. The model being fallen back from has usually just failed, so it cannot be asked for a summary either, and the rung itself cannot hold the transcript. The deterministic, provider-free slice is the only reduction available, and the recorded transcript stays intact in the session file.
- Rejecting the rung fails a chain whose rungs are all smaller than the model that just failed, which is the case a fallback chain exists for.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The repair has to run between the `model_select` hook and the admission guard inside `_switchActiveModel`, a window no extension can observe, and it mutates session context that only the session owns.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` around the `_switchActiveModel` guard. PR #1338 rewrites the same seam to *skip* incompatible rungs; this supersedes that policy.
- Coverage: `test/suite/regressions/1873-fallback-rung-repair.test.ts`.

## 2026-09-20 - A switch one compaction would admit is held, not refused (senpi#1873)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: a switch whose target reports `fits-after-compaction` is registered as `_pendingModelSwitch` instead of throwing. `_setModel` holds it only after the auth check has passed, so a pending switch can never be waiting on a model with no key, and returns without touching durable state. `_switchActiveModel` gained `allowDeferral`, off for the two paths that must settle now: applying a held switch (re-holding would defer the same switch forever) and the fallback lanes (their retry is the next request).
- `_applyPendingModelSwitch` runs from `_enforceCompactionBeforeProvider` ahead of the resume branch. It compacts with the model still holding the transcript, aims the reduction at the pending model's window through the new `keepRecentTokensOverride` on `CompactionExecutionRequest`, falls back to `planResumeSlice` when summarization did not get there, and only then calls `_switchActiveModel`. A transcript that still does not fit records the refusal and throws, so a held switch cannot strand the session.
- `_projectPendingSwitchFit` measures the reduced transcript per message with `estimateTokens` rather than through `estimateContextTokens`: a retained turn keeps the usage it reported before the reduction, so a usage-derived total reports the pre-compaction size and would reject a compaction that actually worked.
- `_modelChangeWouldExhaustContext` now skips a cycle candidate only when the verdict is `impossible`, and a held switch emits `model_change_pending`, which the interactive mode renders.

### Why

- Refusing the switch discards what the user asked for and leaves the session on the old model; #1378's cycle skip does the same silently. Resume already had the repair (admit, compact before the first prompt, revalidate) but it was keyed to the resume admission. Holding the switch reuses that shape for the case users actually hit.
- The compaction has to run before the switch, not after: `_runPrePromptCompaction` summarizes with `this.model`, so switching first would ask the model that cannot hold the transcript to summarize it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Pending-switch state lives in the session's admission and pre-provider compaction path. No public hook can hold a refused switch, order a compaction against a model other than the active one, or re-enter the switch once the transcript fits.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` around `_setModel`, the `_switchActiveModel` options, and the head of `_enforceCompactionBeforeProvider`; PR #1338 rewrites the same guard seam for its fallback preflight.
- LOW: `_executeCompaction`'s settings resolution, which PR #1735 also touches.
- Coverage: `test/suite/regressions/1873-deferred-model-switch.test.ts`, plus the two re-pinned cases in `test/suite/model-usability-budget.test.ts`.

## 2026-09-20 - A model switch stops charging the speculation lead at admission (senpi#1873)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_assertModelUsableForSwitch` now passes `includeSpeculationLead: admission === "start"`, so an actual switch on a live session is admitted without the lead while the cold-start floor keeps charging it. The guard seam itself is unchanged - every refusal still records a `model_change_rejected` entry and rethrows the original error (#1526).

### Why

- #1339 removed the lead from resume admission because speculation cannot shrink a transcript it has not been admitted to yet, and closed with the note that a live switch could keep charging it. That held only while refusal was the sole outcome, so the lead doubled as a refusal margin. It refuses real switches on its own: in the session that prompted #1873 the shortfall was 44110 tokens against a lead of 32768, and the regression test reproduces the same shape at a 31549-token shortfall against a 32549-token lead. Admission decides whether the next single request fits; speculation runs after the switch is admitted.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The switch guard is core session state: it runs inside `_setModel` and `_switchActiveModel`, before any extension-visible model change is emitted, and no hook can relax or re-run it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `agent-session.ts` around `_assertModelUsableForSwitch`, a five-line body that #1526 and #1338 both touch.
- Coverage: `test/suite/model-usability-budget.test.ts` (`admits a switch that only the speculation lead would have rejected`, and the updated lead assertion in `rejects a downswitch before committing when live context exceeds the target budget`).

## 2026-09-20 - Fable 5 ships an Opus-only default fallback chain (senpi#1860)

### What changed

- `retry-fallback/settings.ts`: `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_CHAINS` carries `claude-fable-5-1` and `claude-fable-5`, each
  `["claude-opus-5:max", "claude-opus-4-8:max", "claude-opus-4-6:max"]`, and `resolveFallbackChains` layers user
  chains over a clone of that map again instead of returning user configuration alone. A same-named user key still
  replaces the default outright, an empty array stays the tombstone canonicalization needs, and a malformed map
  falls back to the defaults.
- Every rung is `:max` because the catalog publishes only that level for `claude-opus-4-6`
  (`thinkingLevelMap: {"max": "max"}`); `claude-opus-5` and `claude-opus-4-8` publish it too.
- `test/suite/retry-fallback-chains.test.ts` pins the shipped ladder, the Anthropic-only rungs, and that an
  unrelated user key does not delete the defaults. `test/suite/retry-fallback-expansion.test.ts` restores the two
  tombstone assertions to the per-provider semantics their own test names describe: emptying one canonical key
  leaves the other provider variant, and an explicit canonical chain overrides only its own provider.

### Why

- `daa81b0ed5` (2026-09-05) emptied the map because the default it removed led with `k3:max` / `kimi-k3:max`: that
  moved a Claude session onto another vendor as the FIRST hop, and bare-family expansion ranks OAuth lanes first,
  so the hop could land on a lane guaranteed to refuse (senpi#978). Both problems belong to cross-family leading
  rungs, not to shipping a default at all.
- The cost of the empty map is that a fresh install has no escape hatch: a refusal or a 429 on Fable 5 writes
  `no_chain` to `fallback.log` and ends the turn, while same-family Opus models sit in the same registry.
- An Anthropic-only step-down keeps the session inside one model family and one tool dialect, so a fallback is a
  step down in capability instead of a change of vendor. There is still deliberately no wildcard lane.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Chain resolution runs inside `settings-manager.ts` -> `resolveRetryFallbackSettings` before any extension is
  bound, and `RetryFallbackController` reads the resolved map directly. No extension hook observes or contributes
  fallback chains.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_CHAINS` and `resolveFallbackChains` in
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/settings.ts`.

## 2026-09-20 - Preserve initial model provenance through services (#1560)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts` accepts the SDK's existing provenance type and forwards it unchanged.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts` dropped explicit/scoped provenance, leaving `session_start` without the resolved selection source.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts` constructs the session before extension startup handlers run.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the options interface and SDK forwarding object in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`.

## 2026-09-20 - Skill assets embedded in a compiled binary are read without a descriptor (senpi#1852)

### What changed

- `skill-discovery.ts` `readSkillMarkdownSource` now falls back to `readFileSync` when `openSync` refuses the
  path, and keeps the bounded 8 KiB prefix read for every file that does open. The frontmatter slicing is
  shared, so both paths return the same source.

### Why

- A Bun single-file executable serves embedded assets from a virtual filesystem that answers `existsSync`,
  `statSync` and `readFileSync` but hands out no file descriptors. `loadSkills` accepts such a path through
  its `existsSync` + `statSync` guards and then failed inside the reader with `ENOENT ... open`, so every
  skill contributed as an embedded asset - the builtin `imagegen` skill today - was dropped and reported as a
  `Skill conflicts` warning on every start of a compiled build. The descriptor read arrived with the
  2026-09-17 frontmatter-prefix change (senpi#1781); before it, `readFileSync` loaded those skills fine.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Skill discovery and frontmatter parsing run in the host resource loader before any extension is bound.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the head of `readSkillMarkdownSource` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skill-discovery.ts`.

## 2026-09-19 - Package resolution is memoized per host, keyed on its real inputs (senpi#1844)

### What changed

- `resolved-paths-memo.ts` (new, 41 LOC): a module-scoped LRU of 16 that memoizes the PROMISE of
  `packageManager.resolve()` + `resolveExtensionSources(additionalExtensionPaths)`, keyed on a
  stable digest of `{ agentDir, cwd, globalSettings, projectSettings, additionalExtensionPaths }`.
  A rejected computation is evicted so the next caller retries.
- `resource-loader.ts` resolves through it from ONE private `resolvePackagePaths()`, used by both
  `reload()` and the pre-trust bootstrap pass `loadCurrentExtensionSet()`. The bootstrap pass
  had its own un-memoized pair of calls, so a session in a trust-requiring project resolved
  twice per open with only the second memoized; now each pass shares its own entry (the keys
  differ: the bootstrap pass sees untrusted project settings). The key is computed AFTER
  `settingsManager.reload()`, so a settings change yields a new key.

### Why

On the daemon, `reload()` cost ~150 ms per open warm and interleaved (SENPI_TIMING marks,
aggregated): `packageResolve` 68 ms, per-extension `module import` 77 ms, `factory` 3 ms. The
first is discovery over the agent dir's installed packages - identical for every session of a host
whose set is fixed - and it was rerun by every open, N-way interleaved on one loop for N concurrent
opens. Memoizing the promise makes N concurrent opens of one key await ONE resolution.
Measured after: `packageResolve` 68 -> 0-1 ms on warm opens; warm concurrent `reload` 150 -> 53 ms.
Built daemon over its socket, 8 rounds alternating against `main` (which already carries the shared
model runtime): 8 concurrent opens 448 -> 320 ms wall median (~29%), single warm open 222 -> 168 ms
(~24%), 0 failed. Invalidation pinned with real loaders: a `settings.json` change makes the next
loader resolve again; three concurrent loaders share one in-flight resolution.

### What CI caught, and the fix

`hooks-builtin-extension` failed on the first push: a test edits a package's own `package.json`
(which hooks it declares) and reloads. Settings are unchanged, so the key was unchanged, so the memo
served the stale manifest. Resolution reads manifest content on disk, which a settings digest cannot
see. The old per-loader path handled this through the re-load signal - `if (this.loaded)
clearExtensionCache()` - which the memo had bypassed. A re-load of the same loader now passes
`refresh: true` through both call sites and replaces the entry; only a FRESH loader (a new session on
a shared host) reads through the memo. Pinned: reload twice on one loader = 2 resolves, and a fresh
loader afterwards adds none. 56 suites that construct a loader or call `reload()`: 538/538.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Package resolution is what decides WHICH extensions load; it runs before any extension of the
session exists.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `resource-loader.ts` - the two `packageManager` awaits at the top of `reload()` and the
  import block from `./extensions/loader.ts`.

### What did NOT ship, and why

A synchronous fast path in `extensions/loader.ts` for already-cached factories was built on the
hypothesis that the per-extension `await` hop was the remaining cost. Measured: `module import`
49 -> 48 ms. Reverted; a change that measures as a no-op has no place in a perf change. Only 15 of
the 49 extensions reach `loadExtension` at all - builtins take the inline route - so that remaining
~48 ms spans two code paths and is the next step on #1844.

## 2026-09-19 - A shared model runtime refreshes only what this session registered (senpi#1844)

### What changed

- `agent-session-services.ts` records the provider ids its replay loop registers. When the
  caller injected `options.modelRuntime`, the trailing refresh is
  `refresh({ providers: [those ids] })`, and is skipped when none were registered. A runtime
  built for this session still refreshes everything, as before.

### Why

The in-process daemon now hands one `ModelRuntime` to every session (see `src/changes.md`,
same date). With that in place the unconditional `modelRuntime.refresh()` recomposed every
provider the shared instance had accumulated, on every open, serialized on the one instance -
measured 29-118 ms against ~5 ms on a per-session runtime - and cost more than the parallel
`create` it replaced. Scoped to what this open added, the two paths reach the same state:
everything else was refreshed by whoever added it. Built daemon over its socket: single warm
open 277 -> 162 ms median; eight concurrent 507 -> 439 ms wall median.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The refresh runs in the services layer after the replay of extension provider registrations
and before any session exists. An extension has no hook there and cannot see whether the
runtime it registered into is private or shared.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session-services.ts` - the provider replay loop and the `modelRuntime.refresh` call
  that follows it.

## 2026-09-18 - Default B.AI model selection

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: adds `bai/gpt-5.6-sol` to
  `defaultModelPerProvider`.

### Why

- Every built-in provider needs a resolvable default for CLI startup and model selection. B.AI is dynamic at
  runtime, but its generated classified catalog still owns the default model identity.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Default provider selection runs in the core resolver before extension code can amend the built-in map.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: one entry in `defaultModelPerProvider`.

## 2026-09-17 - Launch profile carries the session's kind and context to its resources (senpi#1782)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`: `AgentSessionLaunchProfile` gains the optional `sessionKind` and `sessionContext`, the immutable per-session inputs an `open_session` selects. They are absent for classic launches.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: `DefaultResourceLoaderOptions` gains the same two optional fields; the loader keeps one `ExtensionSessionProfile` (`sharedHostEnabled` + kind + context, defaults `interactive`/`{}`) and passes THAT to `loadExtensions` and `loadExtensionFromFactory`, replacing the bare `sharedHostEnabled` argument it used to thread through `loadExtensionFactories`.

### Why

- The per-session identity a shared RPC host accepts has to reach the extensions that session loads, and the resource loader is the only per-session construction seam between the launch profile and the extension API. Carrying one value object instead of a third boolean keeps the loader's signatures at their current arity.
- It stops there on purpose: `main.ts` feeds it to `resourceLoaderOptions` only, never into the parsed CLI configuration, so it can never influence auth, model or flag resolution.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Extensions are constructed BY the resource loader; the value has to exist before any extension factory runs.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `AgentSessionLaunchProfile` interface and the `DefaultResourceLoader` constructor/extension-loading helpers.

## 2026-09-17 - Credential and footer probes resolve off the event loop (senpi#1782)

### What changed

- `resolve-config-command.ts` (new) owns execution of a `!command` config value: `runConfigCommand(commandConfig, env?)` spawns the command with `child_process.spawn` (`stdio: [ignore|pipe, "pipe", "ignore"]`, output capped at the 1 MiB `maxBuffer` equivalent, 10 s deadline enforced by a timer that SIGTERMs and unrefs the child) and retries a failed attempt 3x with the same `[250, 1000]` ms backoff, now `await sleep(...)` instead of `Atomics.wait`. The win32 configured-shell attempt (`getShellConfig`, stdin transport) and its fallback to the platform shell are unchanged in shape.
- `resolve-config-value.ts` keeps parsing, env templates and the process-wide command cache and lost every blocking primitive (`spawnSync`, `execSync`, `Atomics.wait`). `resolveConfigValue`, `resolveConfigValueUncached`, `resolveConfigValueOrThrow` and `resolveHeadersOrThrow` return promises; the cache now stores the in-flight promise, so concurrent sessions resolving the same command share one execution. The unused `resolveHeaders` export is removed.
- Awaited at every caller: `auth-storage.ts` (`ReadOnlyAuthStorage.read`, `AuthStorage.read` - both already async), `credential-pool/rotation-stream.ts` (`listRotationSlots`, the policy-slot `flatMap` became a loop), `provider-api-key-auth.ts` (`composeApiKeyAuth.resolve`, the ambient resolver, `resolveBaseAuth`), `provider-composer.ts` (`composeOAuthAuth.toAuth`, `resolveConfiguredModelHeaders`), `model-runtime.ts` (`getAuth`).
- `CompatibilityRequestConfig` no longer carries `headers`, and `resolveCompatibilityRequestConfig(model, config, extension)` dropped its `env` parameter: header resolution moved to the new async `resolveCompatibilityRequestHeaders(model, config, extension, env?)` / `ModelRuntime.getCompatibilityRequestHeaders(model, env?)`. `model-registry.ts` (`ModelRegistry.getApiKeyAndHeaders`) awaits it in the one branch that used those headers (no credential resolved); `AgentSession` and `sdk.ts` keep reading `extraBody`, `upstreamModelId`, `serviceTier` and `authHeader` synchronously.
- `footer-data-provider.ts`: `resolveBranchWithGitSync` and `resolveGitBranchSync` are gone. `getGitBranch()` reads `.git/HEAD` and, for a reftable HEAD (`ref: refs/heads/.invalid`), answers `"detached"` and starts the existing async probe; when git answers, the cached branch is replaced and `onBranchChange` subscribers are notified. Spec change: the first `getGitBranch()` in a reftable repo returns `"detached"` instead of the branch, and the branch arrives through the change notification the footer already subscribes to.

### Why

- A socket host now runs every session in its own process (senpi#1782), so a synchronous credential probe is a whole-daemon outage: a stored `!command` credential was resolved with `execSync`/`spawnSync` (10 s timeout, 3 attempts, `Atomics.wait` backoff) inside `AuthStorage.read`, and the footer's reftable branch probe ran `spawnSync git` per session. Measured on a live host before the change, a `!sleep 3` credential made an unrelated session's `get_state` take 15,285 ms; after it, 1 ms.
- The audit added in senpi#1782 (`test/suite/no-sync-in-session-path.test.ts`) fails on any blocking primitive reachable from session command handling that its ledger does not record, and it reaches `resolveConfigValueUncached` through `model-runtime.getAuth` -> `resolveConfiguredModelHeaders` -> `resolveHeadersOrThrow`, so the whole resolution chain had to go async, not just the credential read the ticket named.
- `CompatibilityRequestConfig` was split rather than made async because `AgentSession` reads `serviceTier`/`upstreamModelId`/`extraBody` from synchronous getters; only the headers can execute a command, and only one caller consumes them.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Credential resolution, provider composition and the footer's git probe are host-owned code paths below the extension boundary; an extension runs inside the very event loop being freed.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: the exported signatures in `resolve-config-value.ts` (every consumer now awaits) and the `headers` field of `CompatibilityRequestConfig`.
- LOW: the branch-resolution block of `footer-data-provider.ts`, the policy-slot loop in `rotation-stream.ts`, the header lines in `provider-api-key-auth.ts` / `provider-composer.ts`.

## 2026-09-17 - Time the interactive startup seams and overlap the two startup branches (senpi#1781)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/timings.ts`: adds the `tui` namespace to `TimingLabel`, takes its marks from `performance.now()` instead of `Date.now()`, and rounds only when printing or formatting.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/startup-branch-join.ts` (new): settles two independent startup branches and rethrows the primary branch's error first, so the model-runtime failure still wins when both fail and neither branch leaves an unhandled rejection.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`: runs `ModelRuntime.create` and `DefaultResourceLoader.reload` concurrently through that join; the drain, refresh and flag diagnostics stay after it, so their order is unchanged.

### Why

- The largest startup phase was reported as one opaque number, and a whole-millisecond clock cannot resolve the 20-60 ms items that remain. The first instrumented run showed the session rebind is 91% of that phase.
- The model runtime and the resource loader share no objects: the loader is constructed from cwd, agent dir and the settings manager, while the runtime reads auth and the model catalogs. Sequencing them cost the I/O wait they could have shared.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Startup instrumentation and service construction both run before the extension host exists.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `TimingLabel` union and the print helpers in `timings.ts`; MEDIUM: the services construction order in `agent-session-services.ts`.

## 2026-09-17 - Record a pre-main phase and stop resolving !command keys at startup (senpi#1781)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/timings.ts` exports `recordTiming(label, ms, namespace)`, which appends an entry with a caller-supplied duration and leaves the namespace cursor alone, so `main()` can report the phase that ended before its first instrumented statement.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-api-key-auth.ts`: `composeApiKeyAuth.check` treats a stored credential as winning only when it actually carries a key, so a models.json `!command` or env `apiKey` is classified without calling `inherited.resolve`; `resolveBaseAuth` falls through to the configured command when the stored credential is keyless, so the first request path still executes the helper.

### Why

- The pre-main phase (runtime boot, `cli.js`, the entry import graph) is over before any instrumented statement runs, so it can only be read from `process.uptime()`; `time()` can only express "now minus the last mark".
- A CPU profile of an interactive boot showed `execSync` through `executeWithDefaultShell` and `resolveConfigValueOrThrow` reached from `resolveBaseAuth`: a keyless stored credential skipped the classification branch and ran the helper during startup.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Startup timing instrumentation is host-internal, and provider composition plus `!command` resolution live in core auth.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the new export in `timings.ts`; `composeApiKeyAuth.check` and `resolveBaseAuth` in `provider-api-key-auth.ts`.

## 2026-09-17 - Read only the frontmatter prefix during skill discovery (senpi#1781)

### What changed

- New `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skill-discovery.ts` owns `collectSkillEntries` / `collectAutoSkillEntries` (moved out of `package-manager.ts`) and `readSkillMarkdownSource`.
- `readSkillMarkdownSource` reads at most 8 KiB, slices at the closing `---` when that delimiter is inside the prefix (falling back to the rest of the file when it is not), and never feeds the markdown body to the YAML parser.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts` `loadSkillFromFile` uses that reader, and the directory walk skips `node_modules`, `.git` and dot-prefixed names.

### Why

- The startup `skills` phase read whole `SKILL.md` bodies only to parse their frontmatter. Extracting the walk also keeps `package-manager.ts` from growing further.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Skill discovery and frontmatter parsing run in the host resource loader before any extension is bound.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `collectSkillEntries` used to live in `package-manager.ts`, so upstream edits to that walk must land in `skill-discovery.ts`.
- LOW: the `loadSkillFromFile` read path in `skills.ts`.

## 2026-09-17 - Inline skill mentions expand on submit (senpi#1778)

### What changed

- New `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skill-invocation.ts` holds `formatSkillInvocationPrompt`, `parseSkillBlock`, `parseSkillInvocationTokens`, `removeSkillInvocationTokens` and the two caps (moved out of `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`, which re-exports them and passes the loaded skill names from `_expandSkillCommand`).
- `parseSkillInvocationTokens(text, { knownSkillNames })`: outside the leading run a bare `$name` is executable when it names a loaded skill; `$skill:name` stays executable without the list; `$HOME`, `$1` and unknown names stay literal. The explicit form is unchanged for the desktop.
- `parseSkillBlock` returns `skills: ParsedSkillBlockSkill[]` for every chained block (`name`/`location`/`content` mirror the first). `packages/coding-agent/src/core/export-html/template.js` (parser + tree/entry render) and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/export-html/template.css` (`.skill-invocation-name`) follow the same shape and list every invoked skill.

### Why

- senpi#1778: an inline `$commit` reached the model as literal text and the transcript named only the first of several expanded skills.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Skill expansion runs in the session's prompt path before extension `input` handlers see the composed text.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: the skill-invocation section of `agent-session.ts` is now an import + re-export block; upstream edits to those functions must land in `skill-invocation.ts`.

## 2026-09-16 - Slow-stream retry branch and its settings withdrawn (senpi#1759)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the retry branch for the agent loop's rate verdict, the session event it emitted when no fallback candidate remained, and its arm of the provider-error log kind are removed. Stalls, refusals and the 429 tiers are unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: the getter that forwarded those thresholds to the agent is removed.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/settings.ts`: the three `retry.provider` rate fields are removed from `ProviderRetrySettings`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: the wiring that passed them to the `Agent` next to `timeoutMs` / `streamStartTimeoutMs` is removed.

### Why

- The agent-loop rate guard those knobs configured aborted healthy turns and was withdrawn (senpi#1759). With no such verdict reaching the session, the retry branch is unreachable and the settings configure nothing.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Retry budget, fallback chain and turn termination live in `AgentSession`, and the settings surface is host-owned; an extension can neither add nor remove either.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: the retry class chain in `_handleRetryableError` is back to stall / refusal / 429 tiers only, so an upstream edit there applies without the fork-local arm.
- LOW: the settings getter and the `ProviderRetrySettings` fields.

## 2026-09-16 - Stalled turns end with recovery guidance (senpi#1740)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` adds the private `_terminalFailureText(message, attempts)` and uses it for the `auto_retry_end.finalError` of an exhausted transient retry. A provider-stream stall is rewritten through `describeProviderStallForUser` (imported from `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat`) with the stalled model selector, the attempts spent and a recovery hint chosen from `RetryFallbackController.hasConfiguredChain()` (`chain-exhausted` vs `no-fallback-configured`); every other failure keeps `message.errorMessage` verbatim. The assistant message itself is left untouched, so `isProviderStreamStallError` and the retry/fallback routing are unchanged.

### Why

- senpi#1740: when a provider accepted a request and never streamed a first event, the session's visible outcome was the watchdog's interpolated message (`Provider stream start timed out after 180000ms`). It names no cause and no next step, and the same string has to stay on the message because the retry classifier matches on it - so the rewrite belongs at the event the UI renders, not at the message.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `auto_retry_end` is emitted by the session at the moment it gives the turn up; only the session knows the attempts spent and whether a fallback chain existed.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: one import specifier, one new private method before `_degradeRateLimitedWithoutFallback`, and one `finalError:` line in the generic transient-exhaustion branch of `_handleRetryableError`.

## 2026-09-16 - /rename session command

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts` adds the `/rename [name]` builtin and keeps `/name` as an alias that describes the same session-rename action.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts` registers unbound-by-default `app.session.renameCurrent` ("Rename the current session").

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts` is the catalog `/help` and command discovery read, so the new command has to live there for the TUI to list it.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts` owns the bindable action table; a key that opens the current-session rename editor cannot be registered from an extension's command list.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts` is the host builtin catalog. An extension can add its own command, but it cannot replace the built-in `/name` row or insert `/rename` into that list.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts` owns first-class `app.session.*` ids that the interactive editor already dispatches; an extension cannot add `app.session.renameCurrent` there.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts`: the `name` row in `BUILTIN_SLASH_COMMANDS`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts`: `AppKeybindings` / `KEYBINDINGS` next to `app.session.resume`.

## 2026-09-16 - session_shutdown handler budget settings (senpi#1732)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` adds the typed `sessionShutdownHandlerWarnMs` (default 2000) and `sessionShutdownHandlerTimeoutMs` (default 10000) settings with `getSessionShutdownHandlerWarnMs`/`setSessionShutdownHandlerWarnMs` and `getSessionShutdownHandlerTimeoutMs`/`setSessionShutdownHandlerTimeoutMs`, validated through the existing `parseTimeoutSetting` path (finite, >= 0, 0 disables) exactly like `httpIdleTimeoutMs`, plus the exported `DEFAULT_SESSION_SHUTDOWN_HANDLER_WARN_MS` / `DEFAULT_SESSION_SHUTDOWN_HANDLER_TIMEOUT_MS` constants the extension runner falls back to.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` owns global/project settings precedence and validation, so the host's shutdown-handler budget has to be a typed setting there for users to tune or disable it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` is read by the extension runner during teardown; an extension cannot define a setting that bounds the host's own wait on extensions.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: the `Settings` interface next to `httpIdleTimeoutMs`/`websocketConnectTimeoutMs`, the timeout default constants near `DEFAULT_STREAM_START_TIMEOUT_MS`, and the accessors directly after `setHttpIdleTimeoutMs`.

## 2026-09-16 - Export kernelTools storage (senpi#1647)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/index.ts` exports `kernelToolsStorage` and `ExtensionKernelTools` so codemode can bind a JS eval's kernel-tool capability onto the host-tool context.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/index.ts` is the public senpi extension API surface consumed by senpi-codemode.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Package index re-exports are owned by coding-agent.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/index.ts` adjacent to other extension exports.

## 2026-09-14 - Terminal mouse capture setting (senpi#1645)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` adds persisted `getTerminalMouse`/`setTerminalMouse` accessors, defaulting to `whilePending`, validating writes and rejecting unknown values. `packages/coding-agent/src/core/terminal-settings.ts` extends the typed settings shape with the shared `off | whilePending | always` value schema.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` must provide a durable opt-out for regular and fullscreen capture while keeping the default renderer unchanged.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` owns global/project precedence and persisted terminal preferences; renderer construction happens before extension registration.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: terminal-settings import and terminal accessors adjacent to clearOnShrink. The settings shape module is fork-owned.

## 2026-09-14 - Session-owned by-name activation and tool_search hidden hints (senpi#1682)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_activateLazyTool` promotes a lazily-activatable **search-exposed** tool itself when no tool-search catalog claims it, so a deferred tool activates on a by-name call even in a session without the tool-search builtin (exposure metadata owns the path; the catalog only enriches it). Eval-exposed tools are never promoted this way; they stay reachable only through the eval cell. `_bindToolSearchRemovedHints` binds `agent.removedToolHints` into the tool-search service at construction and after `bindCore`, so a `tool_search` query naming an eval-only or removed tool answers with that tool's redirect hint.

### Why

- The lazy activator lived only in the tool-search service, so deferred tools (e.g. `generate_image`) could not activate by name without the builtin loaded; the eval-only redirect existed only in the unknown-tool error path, leaving `tool_search` to answer "No tools matched" for hidden tools.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Both hooks are session internals: the active-set promotion behind `_activateLazyTool` and the `agent.removedToolHints` record are owned by `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`, which no extension API exposes for reading.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: two small additions in `_installAgentToolHooks` / `_activateLazyTool` and one call after `bindCore`; both are fork-owned regions.

## 2026-09-14 - Restore grep as an eval-only default tool (#1678)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: remove the temporary grep catalog and default-selection filters, their import, and the now-unused explicit-selection flag. The catalog includes grep for codemode schema discovery; the declared eval-only policy alone controls model exposure and programmatic execution.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: add grep to both initial default lists so sessions without eval expose it directly. Configured defaults, explicit allowlists/exclusions, and find/ls selections are unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-prompt.ts`: derive the eval-only search guideline from contributed grep snippets absent from the selected tool list, shared with the dynamic tool section. Prefer tool.grep inside eval over shell search, without recommending direct bash when it is withheld.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the temporary filter hid grep from getAllTools(), which codemode uses for listTools, and prevented declared exposure from entering the eval-only policy.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: registration alone does not activate grep in their independently seeded defaults.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-prompt.ts`: selected tools intentionally exclude eval-only grep and bash, while their contributions survive; guidance must preserve that distinction.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` owns the catalog, selection, and executable registry. `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts` seeds the session defaults before extensions bind.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-prompt.ts` owns the legacy fallback guidance and shared conditional search guideline consumed by dynamic prompt assembly.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: definitionRegistry, nextActiveToolNames, and _buildRuntime defaults. Preserve allowlist/exclusion predicates but do not restore temporary grep filters.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: defaultActiveToolNames. Keep explicit and configured selection precedence intact.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-prompt.ts`: file-exploration guidance and getEvalOnlyGrepGuideline. Contributions must not re-advertise withheld tools as direct calls.

## 2026-09-14 - Load standalone codemode from its sidecar only

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` removes the compiled factory bypass and loads the staged codemode manifest entries through the ordinary extension importer. Compiled inventory retains `<builtin:codemode>` while resolved paths and assets remain on disk.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` previously embedded codemode implementation in addition to shipping its source tree. The standalone distribution now ships that implementation once (Refs #1656).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` owns the host's builtin loading and compile-time dependency edge; the loaded extension cannot remove its own bundled factory.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- Bundled package registration and `loadExtensionFactories()` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`.

## 2026-09-13 - Session cwd and authoritative goal-store environment (#1663)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts` adds optional read-only `ExtensionContext.goalStoreFile`, preserving hand-built context compatibility.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/runner.ts` implements the guarded lazy getter once in `createContext()` through `goalFilePath(goalStoreRef(sessionManager, cwd))`, honoring persisted, overridden-directory, and in-memory sessions without creating a goal file.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/bash.ts` clears inherited `PI_SESSION_CWD` and `PI_GOAL_STORE_FILE` before setting context values, including opt-out and custom spawn-hook semantics.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/terminal/tools/bash.ts` supplies the same values for foreground/background PTY bash and clears inherited values even when no context or optional goal path is supplied. Explicit undefined overrides preserve deletion through PTY backends that merge the host environment.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/runner.ts` expose facts consumers cannot infer from the session JSONL path, especially with a session-directory override or no persisted session.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/bash.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/terminal/tools/bash.ts` must not route child processes to stale inherited session paths; the session cwd is not necessarily the child's overridden working directory.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/runner.ts` own the host context and its lifecycle guards; an extension cannot add a universally available authoritative context getter.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/bash.ts` owns core child spawn environment construction. `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/terminal/tools/bash.ts` owns its independent PTY spawn boundary. A consumer extension cannot sanitize all children at either boundary.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the session-manager neighborhood of `ExtensionContext` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts`, and imports plus `createContext()` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/runner.ts`.
- LOW: `resolveSpawnContext()` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/bash.ts`; session environment and the two spawn sites in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/terminal/tools/bash.ts`.

### Tests

- `test/suite/session-goal-store-context.test.ts`: persisted, `SessionManager.open(path, otherSessionDir)`, and in-memory goal paths; getter reads do not create files.
- `test/suite/bash-session-env.test.ts`: real registered shell children, opt-out, optional getter omission.
- `test/suite/terminal-bash-session-env.test.ts`: real foreground/background PTY children, execute-time/fallback contexts, inherited-value clearing.
- `test/sdk-session-manager.test.ts`: SDK-created session values through the registered bash surface.



## 2026-09-13 - Configurable pending-question arrival bell (senpi#1645)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-shapes.ts` adds optional `AskUserSettings.bell`; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` resolves it to true by default and honors an explicit false value. `docs/settings.md` documents the bell and pending-title behavior.

### Why

- Question arrivals should be noticeable without forcing an audible signal on users who disable it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The core settings manager owns global/project merge precedence and the typed ask-user settings contract consumed by the interactive host.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-shapes.ts`: AskUserSettings; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: getAskUserSettings.

## 2026-09-13 - Pending-question cycling keybinding (senpi#1645)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts` adds `app.question.next`, default `alt+down`, for cycling pending requests from an empty composer. Tab autocomplete and Shift+Tab thinking cycling are unchanged.
- The answer action defaults to both `alt+up` and the retained `alt+a`. Exported primary/fallback key constants keep terminal-aware hints tied to the binding table. Pending-question interception precedes dequeue without changing its handler; Windows/WSL retain their independent `alt+q` dequeue key.

### Why

- Multiple requests need a configurable cycling chord without taking existing editor actions.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts` owns the app binding table and its TUI type augmentation; host dispatch and hints must share that declaration.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts`: AppKeybindings and KEYBINDINGS question entries.


## 2026-09-13 - Invocation-scoped steering notification (senpi#1637)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` binds each registered tool invocation to the existing synchronous queue-update event through a separate AbortSignal. Registration precedes the queued-steering check; completion, caller abort and session disposal remove the subscription. Context getters remain live.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` owns the steering queue. Foreground tools need push notification without consuming messages or treating follow-up input as cancellation.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` owns both queue updates and registered tool invocation lifetimes below the extension API; an extension cannot safely subscribe to that queue through the existing context.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: queue-update helpers, disposal, and the two registered-tool wrapper construction sites. Agent-loop queue consumption and cancellation are unchanged.

## 2026-09-13 - `system` provenance scope for harness-provided resources (senpi#1640)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/source-info.ts`: `SourceScope` is now `"user" | "project" | "temporary" | "system"`. `system` marks resources the harness itself provides: `<builtin:*>` and bundled extensions, command-line packages whose manifest declares `pi.system`, and what those contribute.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/pi-manifest.ts`: `PiManifest.system?: boolean`, read from `pkg.pi.system` only when it is a boolean; any other type is ignored.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts`: `collectPackageResources` reads the manifest up front and flips `metadata.scope` from `temporary` to `system` when `manifest.system === true`. Only command-line packages carry the `temporary` scope here, so a package installed through settings keeps its `user`/`project` scope and cannot hide itself from the trust surface. The local `SourceScope` alias is gone in favour of the `source-info.ts` type; `InstalledSourceScope` excludes `system` as well as `temporary`, and the update filter skips both.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: the CLI metadata loop collapses into one `cliMetadata` helper that keeps `source: "cli", scope: "system", origin: "top-level", baseDir: <package root>` for resources that resolved to `system`, and `source: "cli", scope: "temporary"` for everything else, so CLI precedence over settings packages is unchanged. `getDefaultSourceInfoForPath` returns `scope: "system"` for `<builtin:*>` paths. `applyExtensionSourceInfo` resolves bundled extensions to `source: "builtin", scope: "system"` with the bundled package root as `baseDir`, using the new `getBundledExtensionPackageRoots` (which `getBundledExtensionEntryPaths` now wraps), and the generated global-default shims (`diff.js`, `files.js`, `prompt-url-widget.js`, `tps.js` under the agent extensions directory) to the same `system` scope while they still carry the generated banner (`getHarnessExtensionSourceInfo`, `isGeneratedGlobalDefaultExtensionShimPath`); a user-authored file at a shim path keeps the `user` scope.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `resources_discover` results go through `resolveDiscoveredResourcePaths` instead of the removed `buildExtensionResourcePaths` / `getExtensionSourceLabel` methods.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/discovered-resource-scope.ts` (new, fork-only): `DiscoveredResourceEntry`, `getExtensionSourceLabel` and `resolveDiscoveredResourcePaths`. An entry with an explicit `scope` keeps it; a bare path becomes `system` when the contributor is builtin, or is a system package and the path lies inside that package root; otherwise it stays `temporary`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/app-server/server/skills.ts` (fork-only): `mapSkillScope` maps `system` to the app-server `system` skill scope, next to `temporary`.

### Why

- Resources only knew user, project and temporary scopes, so builtin extensions and the package a distribution launcher passes with `--extension` were filed as ad-hoc paths next to the user's own `-e` files. The harness needs a scope of its own so the banner, diagnostics and app-server can tell its resources from the user's.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Scope is assigned by the loader and package manager before any extension runs, and `SourceScope` is the host-owned provenance contract those consumers read. An extension can pin a scope on the paths it contributes, but it cannot change how its own package or the builtins are classified.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: the CLI metadata loop in `DefaultResourceLoader` (`cliMetadata` replaces five identical `for` loops), `getDefaultSourceInfoForPath`, `applyExtensionSourceInfo` and `getBundledExtensionEntryPaths` / `getBundledExtensionPackageRoots` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`.
- MEDIUM: `collectPackageResources` (manifest read moved above the filter branch) and the `InstalledSourceScope` alias plus the update filter in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts`.
- LOW: the `SourceScope` union in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/source-info.ts`; the `system` field in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/pi-manifest.ts`; the `extendResources` call site in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` where the two private helpers were removed.

## 2026-09-12 - O(1) full-history entry count on SessionManager (senpi#1635)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: maintain a non-header entry count on
  append, load and reset; preserve it when compaction trims the resident mirror. Expose it through
  `getEntryCount()` without loading history. Persisted tests cover trim, append, reopen and branch.

### Why

- Count-only UI cadence decisions must not reload and materialize the JSONL after compaction.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The count follows `SessionManager` mutations below the extension boundary.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: count field, `_buildIndex()`, `_appendEntry()`, reset and accessor beside `getEntries()`.

## 2026-09-12 - `app.question.answer` keybinding and `/answer` command for the async ask-user widget (senpi#1623)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts`: new `AppKeybindings` id `app.question.answer`
  (`defaultKeys: "alt+a"`, "Open the pending question"), so the chord that expands a pending async
  question is configurable in `keybindings.json` and visible to `/hotkeys` and the hint system.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/ask-user/extension.ts`: registers the `/answer`
  command ("Open the pending question") so it is listed and autocompleted; in TUI mode interactive-mode's
  text dispatch handles it first (the `/keybindings` pattern), outside the TUI it notifies that the
  command belongs to the TUI.

### Why

- The shortcut lived as a constant in the interactive widget and could not be rebound when another
  keymap claimed Option/Alt+A; `/answer` gives a chord-free path that every terminal delivers.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Keybinding ids are declared once in `KEYBINDINGS` and merged into the `pi-tui` `Keybindings`
  augmentation; an extension cannot add an app-level id that `KeybindingsManager`, `/hotkeys` and
  `keyText` resolve. The `/answer` command is registered through the extension API, but its TUI
  behavior (mounting the overlay) is interactive-mode state that no extension hook reaches.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `AppKeybindings` interface and `KEYBINDINGS` table in `keybindings.ts` (fork-only ids sit
  beside upstream ones); the ask-user extension is fork-only.

## 2026-09-12 - Cursor admission never deletes a turn (senpi#1603)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-history-admission.ts` (new): owns Cursor request admission - the per-tool-result grapheme cap, blanking the oldest tool result bodies against an explicit byte budget, and `cursorAdmissionBudgetBytes` (effective context window x 4 chars per token, matching `core/compaction` `estimateTokens`). `admitCursorHistory` reports `blankedToolResults`, `bytesBefore`, `bytesAfter` and `overBudget`; `truncateToolResultBodies` stays as the positional entry point.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the admission pass moved out of this file and the old names are re-exported from it. The third pass, which deleted the oldest whole turns when blanking was not enough, is gone: an over-budget history is admitted as-is. The `transformContext` closure now applies the observed Cursor ceiling to the live model (`cursor_context_window_observed`), derives the budget from `model.contextWindow`, and logs `cursor_admission_truncated` / `cursor_admission_over_budget`. `_wouldCompactionOverflow` sizes its simulated Cursor context with the same window-derived budget.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/models.ts`: catalog entries materialize `contextWindow` through `resolveCursorContextWindow`.
- Tests: `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/1603-cursor-history-budget.test.ts` (new) and the rewritten aggregate cases in `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/1043-cursor-toolresult-truncate.test.ts`, which now pass explicit budgets and assert that bodies shrink while messages do not.

### Why

- Admission enforced a fixed 50,000-byte cap that had nothing to do with the model window, and measured it over both the prompt blobs and Cursor's display copies of the same conversation. A 1M-token model therefore admitted roughly 6K tokens, and a tool-free history - where there is no body to blank - lost its oldest turns outright, so a codeword or instruction from the first turn was gone before the model ever saw it.
- Cursor rebuilds the conversation each hop, so the pass cannot compact mid-run; the correct answer to an oversized history is to admit it and let the existing 0-token `resource_exhausted` overflow path compact with the session's own policy.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The pass runs inside `AgentSession`'s installed `transformContext` and feeds the same session-owned compaction and context-usage accounting; an extension context hook cannot see the model window admission is budgeting against, and cannot mutate the live model.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` - the constants block above the class and the `transformContext` closure inside `_installAgentNextTurnRefresh`.
- LOW: the new `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-history-admission.ts`.
- LOW: the `contextWindow` line in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/models.ts`.
## 2026-09-12 - Bind session-write grants to live writers (senpi#1612)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-write-reservation.ts` adds a live-writer registry
  (`registerSessionWriter`, `unregisterSessionWriter`, `liveSessionWritePaths`) that holds owners
  weakly, prunes collected ones on enumeration, and reports the current session file of every live
  persisted writer.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` registers every persisted manager in its
  constructor, and splits `newSession()` into `_resetToNewSession()` (state reset and header, no
  path work) plus the path allocation. `_setSessionFile()` now resets in place for a missing or
  empty explicit file instead of allocating and reserving a second path it immediately discards.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts` unregisters the replaced session
  manager after `teardownCurrent()` disposes it, so a superseded session file has no live writer.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/1612-session-manager-single-reservation.test.ts`
  pins that opening a missing or zero-byte session file reserves exactly that one path.

### Why

- Under the shared RPC host every reservation was permanent, so a long-lived session died at the
  64-path worker budget with `session_path_in_use`, and each explicit open burned two grants
  instead of one. Ownership now follows the writer that actually exists.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `SessionManager` and the runtime replacement path own session-file writes below the extension
  boundary; the grant is taken synchronously before any extension observes the new session.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `session-manager.ts` around `newSession()` / `_setSessionFile()`.
- LOW: the `teardownCurrent()` tail in `agent-session-runtime.ts` and the reservation module.

## 2026-09-11 - Batch persisted entry hydration after resident-string eviction (senpi#1407)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-entry-materializer.ts` batches missing resident-string recovery for an ordered materialization pass and performs one authoritative JSONL load.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` uses the batch helper for `getEntries()` and `getBranch()` while preserving cache identity, branch order, and message-entry position tracking.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/session-manager/session-mirror-budget.test.ts` proves that an evicted multi-entry read restores all payloads after one full-history parse.

### Why

- Image-heavy resumed sessions could parse the complete JSONL once per evicted large string, turning a bounded resident cache miss into repeated full-history I/O and JSON parsing.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Resident-string materialization and session branch/cache views are owned by `SessionManager` below the extension boundary.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` materialization and branch/read caches.
- LOW: new `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-entry-materializer.ts` and the resident-mirror regression test.

## 2026-09-11 - Resolve branded changelog sources (senpi#1583)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/changelog-source.ts`: resolves the engine or brand changelog path, source identity, authored version, and link rewriting policy used by interactive notifications.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: stores changelog seen versions in source-keyed settings slots without cross-edition clobbering.

### Why

- Branded installations need an independent changelog source and seen-version namespace while the unbranded engine retains its existing release behavior.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Source selection is required by the interactive host before extension UI can render update notices.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the changelog source resolver and its config imports.

## 2026-09-11 - Keep remote catalog sources clean under the static validation gate

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-merge.ts` is aligned with the repository's
  enforced Biome formatting.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-provider.ts` is aligned with the repository's
  enforced import ordering and formatting.

### Why

- The repository-wide static gate must validate these shared runtime sources without formatter
  drift; the change preserves their behavior and removes only pre-existing formatting violations.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- These are core model-catalog runtime modules checked directly by the repository static gate;
  extensions cannot alter their source formatting or import graph.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW around the remote catalog merge and provider imports.

## 2026-09-11 - Keep static model capabilities authoritative over remote catalog refreshes (senpi#1527)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-merge.ts` validates remote model rows at the ingest boundary, preserves all static capability fields for an existing model ID, refreshes only the remote display name and pricing metadata, preserves static rows omitted by the overlay, and returns named provider/model capability conflicts.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-provider.ts` records merge conflicts for each wrapped provider through `getRemoteCatalogConflicts()` while retaining the existing persisted catalog and refresh lifecycle.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/remote-catalog-authority.test.ts` covers lower context-window protection, omitted `-fast` row preservation, capability conflict reporting, malformed-row rejection, and price metadata refresh.

### Why

- A newer pi.dev catalog could replace a fork-declared model wholesale, silently lowering deliberate tier windows such as Sol 650,000 and Astra 600,000 to 272,000. The same replacement also made stale remote capability metadata authoritative when the static fork catalog carried required rows or compatibility fields.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Remote catalog ingestion and model merging occur inside `ModelRuntime` before extension code can observe or alter the provider registry; an extension-local repair would leave CLI, SDK, and extension-free sessions vulnerable to the same replacement.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-provider.ts` refresh publication and provider wrapper.
- LOW: new `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-merge.ts` and the colocated remote catalog regression tests.

## 2026-09-11 - Keep static model capabilities authoritative over remote catalog refreshes (senpi#1527)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-merge.ts` (new): validates remote model rows at the ingest boundary, preserves all static capability fields for an existing model ID, refreshes only the remote display name and pricing metadata, preserves static rows omitted by the overlay, and returns named provider/model capability conflicts.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-provider.ts`: records the merge conflicts for each wrapped provider through `getRemoteCatalogConflicts()` while retaining the existing persisted catalog and refresh lifecycle.

The same replacement also made stale remote capability metadata authoritative even when the static fork catalog carried required rows or compatibility fields.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Remote catalog ingestion and model merging occur inside `ModelRuntime` before extension code can observe or alter the provider registry; an extension-local repair would leave CLI, SDK, and extension-free sessions vulnerable to the same replacement.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-provider.ts` refresh publication and provider wrapper.
- LOW: new `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-merge.ts` and the colocated remote catalog regression tests.

## 2026-09-11 - Detect auth changes by content rather than mtime

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts` uses SHA-256 file-content revisions for shared reload detection and coalescing.

### Why

- Rapid rewrites may retain the same filesystem mtime and size, so metadata-only revisions can return stale credentials.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The shared auth snapshot and reload-coalescing state are owned by core storage before provider extensions read them.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts` revision reads around reload and cache adoption.

## 2026-09-10 - Atomic account display-name metadata with shape-keyed sentinel guard (senpi#1495)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-accounts.ts`: adds `renameCredentialAccount` with a serialized latest-credential update, optional safe `displayName` in descriptors, and unchanged name-based health/pin reads. Rejected input writes nothing and emits no event; successful rename/clear emits the existing accounts-changed event. The guard that refuses to read a provider-managed sentinel as a legacy flat account is keyed on the credential shape (an OAuth credential with no `accounts` array whose identical `access`/`refresh` are a `*-managed` sentinel), not on the literal provider id `claude-sdk-oauth`, so every managed lane with that envelope is covered. Environment slots are never materialized as saved accounts.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-accounts.ts`: shared CLI/status/RPC/app-server descriptors need human-readable labels without exposing tokens or changing operational IDs; duplicate claims must be validated under the storage lock; and `cursor-cli-oauth` defines the identical sentinel envelope, so a provider-id-keyed guard would let a cosmetic rename fabricate a `default` login slot whose tokens are the literal sentinel strings.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-accounts.ts` is the shared storage and descriptor seam used by commands and transports; an extension-local mutation would bypass its concurrency and non-secret projection contracts.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-accounts.ts` summary projection and the rename operation beside pin/remove.

## 2026-09-10 - Review fixes for PR #1304: scoped remint/auth-miss, pool merge, sentinel repair

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_isClaudeSdkSameModelRemintError` matches ONLY the Claude SDK lane's session-lock and bare `invalid_request` quirks (`this.model?.provider === ANTHROPIC_SUBSCRIPTION_PROVIDER_ID`); the provider-agnostic stream-stall watchdog class is no longer swallowed, so a stall for ANY provider consumes the ordinary shared same-model budget and escalates to the fallback chain exactly as before. The auth-miss exclusion is `_isClaudeSdkAuthMissError`, an exact-message, Claude-lane-scoped check built on the shared `providerNotConfiguredMessage()` helper, so another provider's auth miss still hops the configured fallback chain. Supersedes the 2026-09-02 "Keep Claude SDK stalls and invalid_request on the same model" entry above.
- `packages/ai/src/auth/resolve.ts` + `packages/ai/src/models.ts`: `PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED_PREFIX` / `providerNotConfiguredMessage()` export the exact auth-miss wording; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts` throws through the helper instead of its own literal, so the session-layer guard can never drift from the throw sites (the `TURN_RETRY_SUPPRESSION_PREFIX` pattern).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`: every auth.json parse drops pool slots whose `access`/`refresh` equal the provider's `<providerId>-managed` sentinel and clears a pin naming one; the mutable store writes the repair back once inside its existing lock. `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/classify.ts` classifies that auth miss as `failover`/`auth_error` so one bad slot can never dead-end a pool. `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/anthropic-subscription/accounts.ts` never lists a sentinel-material slot as an account.
- `packages/ai/src/auth/pool/slots.ts`: `appendLoginSlot` MERGES a provider-owned pool onto the value read under the credential lock (stored slots and their block state win; only genuinely new names are appended) instead of whole-writing a snapshot read before the browser round trip; `managedSentinelMaterial` / `isManagedSentinelSlot` / `repairManagedSentinelSlots` implement the repair algebra. A flat `current` keeps the whole-write shape because the provider's accounts already carry this login.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/components/login-dialog.ts`: every `(to cancel)` / `(to close)` hint row routes through one tracked live hint, so `showWaiting` / `showInfo` replace a previous hint instead of painting beside it, and content-clearing paths reset the tracked hint.
- Tests: `test/suite/retry-fallback-hard-error.test.ts` (Claude-lane tests run under a `claude-sdk-oauth` faux provider, plus new guards proving a non-Claude `invalid_request` and a non-Claude auth miss still hop the chain), `test/auth-storage.test.ts`, `test/credential-error-taxonomy.test.ts`, `test/model-runtime-credential-rotation.test.ts`, `test/anthropic-subscription-accounts.test.ts`, `packages/ai/test/credential-pool-mutations.test.ts`, `test/suite/regressions/5433-extension-oauth-prompt-input.test.ts` (the bare-`>` line was a tautology; it now asserts exactly one live `>` row and one live hint row).

### Why

- PR #1304 review (pullrequestreview-5167950734): the remint predicate ORed the provider-agnostic stall class in, so stalls never reached the fallback chain and the exhaustion event's attempt counter drifted by one - three suites that pass at the merge base failed at the branch head. The `Provider is not configured:` exclusion and the `invalid_request` remint were global, reclassifying every provider's failures. `appendLoginSlot`'s early return turned login into a blind overwrite with the pre-browser-flow snapshot, rolling a sibling account's rotated refresh token back to the consumed value and erasing its rate-limit block. Nothing repaired the sentinel `login-N` entries the already-shipped bug wrote, so those pools dead-ended deterministically. `forkBindingOrFlatten` was dropped during the rebase onto main in favor of main's `crossAccountResumeSupported` wiring, which already flattens account drift on the config-dir lane (`cross_root_unsupported`) exactly as `verifyRestoredTranscript` declares.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Hard-error vs same-model retry eligibility, the auth.json parse/repair, the rotation classification, and the shared credential-pool write path all live below every extension hook.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `_isClaudeSdkSameModelRemintError` / `_isClaudeSdkAuthMissError` / `_isHardErrorFallbackEligible` in `agent-session.ts`; `repairPoisonedPoolSlots` and `parseStorageContent` in `auth-storage.ts`; `appendLoginSlot` and the sentinel helpers in `packages/ai/src/auth/pool/slots.ts`; the prefix helpers in `auth/resolve.ts`; the prefix branch in `credential-pool/classify.ts`; `storedSlots` filtering in `accounts.ts`; `setLiveHint` in `login-dialog.ts`.

## 2026-09-02 - Keep Claude SDK stalls and invalid_request on the same model

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `Provider stream start timed out after Nms` and a bare `invalid_request` remint the same model. They are not hard-error provider hops.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/retry-fallback-hard-error.test.ts`: both recover on faux-1 and never apply a fallback chain.

### Why

- After a 1.7MB flatten the SDK timed out, then returned `invalid_request`. Hard-error fallback switched onto `opengateway/anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` which has no key and 401-looped until the goal continuation cap fired.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Hard-error vs same-model retry is decided in `AgentSession` before extension failover runs.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `_isHardErrorFallbackEligible` and the `agent_end` remint branch in `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-02 - Retry Claude SDK session locks on the same model

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `Lock file is already being held` is same-model remint, not hard-error provider fallback.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/retry-fallback-hard-error.test.ts`: lock recovers on the original model and never hops after budget exhaustion.

### Why

- A held Claude Agent SDK session lock cannot be released by switching to OpenGateway or another provider. Immediate hard-error fallback produced 401 storms and `resume_initialization_aborted` resends.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Hard-error vs same-model retry is decided in `AgentSession` before extension failover runs.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `_isHardErrorFallbackEligible` and the `agent_end` retry branch in `agent-session.ts`.

## Shared manual-continue submission predicate (2026-09-10)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/manual-continue.ts`: adds `MANUAL_CONTINUE_SHORTCUT` and `isManualContinueSubmission({ text, hasMessages, hasImages })`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `prompt()` classifies the bare `.` through that predicate instead of an inline condition.

### Why

- Interactive mode must reach the same verdict before it paints a user echo, and one predicate keeps the empty-session and image-attachment carve-outs from drifting between the two call sites.

### Why this lives in the fork

- The `.` manual-continue shortcut is fork behavior in `AgentSession.prompt()`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the manual-continue interception at the top of `prompt()`.

## Record model switches the session refuses (2026-09-09)

## Record model switches the session refuses (2026-09-10)


### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` records every refused model switch before rethrowing. `_assertModelUsableForSwitch()` is the single guard seam: the `_setModel` pre-flight, the post-`model_select` revalidation in `_switchActiveModel`, and both `_cycleFavoriteModel` guards (the sole-alternative case and the pre/post-`model_select` pair) now funnel through it, so each appends a `model_change_rejected` session entry, emits the matching event with the budget projection numbers, and rethrows the original error unchanged. The `_setModel` auth refusal records the same entry with `reason: "auth"`. `_modelSwitchAdmission()` derives the admission from the branch (`hasContextMessages()`) instead of hardcoding `"switch"`, so a refusal only promises the compaction remedy when there is context to compact. `_cycleFavoriteModel` no longer appends its `model_change`, writes the global default, or emits `model_changed`/`service_tier_changed` before the post-`model_select` guard accepts, and its catch restores the previous service tier.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` adds the `ModelChangeRejectedEntry` type (documenting that it follows the shared pre-assistant `_persist` buffering contract) and `appendModelChangeRejected()`.

### Why

- Every guard rejects before `_switchActiveModel` appends its `model_change`, so a refused switch left no entry, no event, and no log line; an attempted-and-rejected switch was indistinguishable from one the user never made (#1526). Recording it on one guard only would have left sibling calls of the same public API silent, and a refused *cycle* was strictly worse than silent: it appended a real `model_change` and wrote the global default before its post-`model_select` guard ran, so the session resumed - and every new session started - on a model that was refused and never answered. The `admission` default only infers `"switch"` when `liveContextTokens > 0`, so the message told the user the model "cannot start" and omitted the compaction remedy; hardcoding `"switch"` instead promised that remedy on the `session_start` caller (`recommended-models`), where there is nothing to compact.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` owns the switch guards, the session-entry append, and the settings write; an extension observes model changes only after they are applied and never sees the rejected path.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the `AgentSessionEvent` union, the `_setModel` guard block, and the `_cycleFavoriteModel` commit block.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: the `SessionEntry` union and the append helpers near `appendModelChange`.

## 2026-09-02 - Do not hard-fallback a provider-not-configured auth miss

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_isHardErrorFallbackEligible` no longer treats `Provider is not configured:` as a model hard-error that ejects onto another provider.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/retry-fallback-hard-error.test.ts`: a configured fallback chain stays unused when the current model fails with that auth miss.

### Why

- Auth wiring failures were classified as hard-error and immediately switched `anthropic-subscription/claude-opus-5` onto a different provider (for example `opengateway/anthropic/claude-opus-5`) instead of staying on Claude SDK OAuth or its sibling accounts.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Hard-error fallback eligibility is decided in `AgentSession` before extension failover runs.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `_isHardErrorFallbackEligible` in `agent-session.ts`.

## Leaf token and typed errors for assistant edits (2026-09-10)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `TreeNavigationOptions.expectedLeafId`; `editAssistantMessage` checks streaming first, then the token (before the `unchanged` short-circuit), and `_navigateTree` checks the token before its no-op return; both streaming guards throw `SessionStreamingError`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/edited-assistant-message.ts`: `AssistantEditReason` gains `stale-leaf`, `AssistantEditError.code` maps reasons to wire codes, `SessionStreamingError`, and `assertExpectedLeaf()`.

### Why

- A client holding a stale view must be refused before any mutation, and every refusal needs a stable code a transport can forward.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The guard has to run inside the core mutation, ahead of `session_before_tree`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `editAssistantMessage` / `_navigateTree` heads in `agent-session.ts`; the fork-only `edited-assistant-message.ts`.

## Honor an inline isError on executeTool results (2026-09-10)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the direct `executeTool` path sets `isError = result.isError === true` after a tool settles, so `tool_result` hooks observe the same error flag the agent loop now derives from a returned `isError: true`.

### Why

- A tool that reports a structured failure without throwing was delivered to `tool_result` hooks as a success on the `pi.executeTool` path, diverging from the agent-loop path fixed in `packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The flag is computed inside `AgentSession` before hooks run; a hook can only override it after the fact and per tool.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `executeTool` try block in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`.
## askUser settings and --no-ask-user session override (2026-09-10)

### What changed

- `settings-shapes.ts`: adds `AskUserSettings` (`enabled`, `timeoutMinutes`) plus clamp constants (default 30, range 1–120).
- `settings-manager.ts`: `Settings.askUser` and `getAskUserSettings()` resolve merged settings with boolean type-checks, default `enabled: true`, and clamped `timeoutMinutes`.
- `agent-session.ts`: `--no-ask-user` in `runtime.flagValues` applies a non-persistent `askUser.enabled=false` override (same path as `--no-model-fallback`) and exposes `getAskUserSettings` on the extension context.

### Why

- The question tool needs a session-readable enable switch and idle timeout, plus a per-run CLI disable that wins over saved settings without writing them.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Settings shapes, merged resolution, and constructor-time flag overrides live on `SettingsManager` / `AgentSession` before extension `session_start`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `settings-shapes.ts` next to `LookAtSettings`; `settings-manager.ts` `Settings` field list and getters next to prompt-cache helpers.
- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` constructor flag overrides next to `--no-model-fallback` and `bindCore` accessors next to `getLookAtSettings`.

## 2026-09-10 - Venice default model and display name

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts` maps `venice` to the default model `z-ai-glm-5-3`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-display-names.ts` (fork-only) labels the provider "Venice AI".

### Why

- Selecting a provider without a model falls back to this map; Venice's GLM 5.3 is the catalog's strongest general coding model with a 1M context window, matching how `zai` and `baseten` default to the same family.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Default-model resolution runs inside model selection, before the session (and its extensions) exists.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `DEFAULT_MODELS` map when upstream adds providers.

## Deterministic resume recovery when the restored context exceeds the window (2026-09-10)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: the resume-admission catch still rethrows for fresh starts, non-budget errors and compaction-disabled sessions, and now splits the remaining case. A projection whose live context still fits the raw window keeps taking the existing compaction-required admission; a projection whose live context alone exceeds the window asks `planResumeSlice()` for a deterministic reduction and rethrows the original budget error unchanged when no safe cut fits.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: new `applyResumeSlice()` appends the reduction as a `senpi.compaction.resume-slice.v1` compaction entry that preserves the recorded transcript, rebuilds the live context, writes one `resume_context_reduced` session-log line, and publishes a `resume_context_reduced` event which `subscribe()` replays for listeners that attach after `createAgentSession()` returns.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` is deliberately unchanged: `_trimMirrorAfterCompaction()` only trims the in-memory mirror, and `getEntries()`, `getEntry()` and `getBranch()` reload the full history from the session file once `mirrorTrimmed` is set, so the recorded transcript already survives an admission-time reduction.

### Why

- Issue #1524: a `gpt-6-astra` session whose restored transcript alone exceeded the model window (live 965,016 tokens against an 850,000-token window) could never be reopened. The compaction-eligible resume branch only relaxes admission while summarization still fits, and the compaction-required admission only covers a live context within the raw window, so this band had no recovery path and every reopen failed inside `assertModelUsable` before any extension was wired.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The refusal happens inside `createAgentSession()` before extensions are loaded or bound, and the recovery must append a session entry and rebuild the live context while the session is still being constructed.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts` resume-admission catch block, which is also the merge zone of the earlier compaction-required admission.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` event union, `subscribe()` replay and the method added beside `admitResumeCompactionRequired()`.
## Editable assistant responses from the session tree (2026-09-10)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `navigateTree()` delegates to a private `_navigateTree()` that also accepts a replacement assistant message; new public `editAssistantMessage(entryId, text, options)` validates the target, treats unchanged text as a no-op (`unchanged: true`), and otherwise branches to the target's parent and appends the edited copy as the new leaf, reusing the branch-summary flow, labels, agent-state restore and `session_before_tree` / `session_tree` events. New exported `TreeNavigationOptions` and `AssistantEditResult` types. Guard order is streaming -> target lookup -> empty-text rejection (built first) -> unchanged no-op, so an identical-text request during a response still throws and a textless (tool-call-only) assistant cannot be "edited" to blank.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/edited-assistant-message.ts` (new): `buildEditedAssistantMessage()` keeps only the trimmed text (tool calls, thinking and provider-native blocks dropped, `stopReason: "stop"`, model/provider/api/usage preserved), `assistantTextEquals()`, and `AssistantEditError`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts`: new `app.tree.editMessage` action (default `ctrl+e`, legacy alias `treeEditMessage`).

### Why

- `/tree` could re-open a user message for editing but offered no way to correct an assistant response; users had to fork or re-prompt to steer past a wrong answer.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Extensions can replace a message only at `message_end` time; rewriting an already persisted entry needs the session leaf move plus append that only `AgentSession` owns, and the tree keybinding lives in the core keybinding registry.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` `navigateTree()` body (renamed to `_navigateTree`, three small hunks for the replacement branch).
- LOW: `keybindings.ts` tree action tables; the new module is fork-only.

## Registration-time shared-host capability (2026-09-09)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` forwards the shared-host policy through extension-loading options.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` owns the effective settings and extension discovery lifecycle needed for capability-gated tool registration.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` loads factories before extensions can access bound session actions.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`: resource-loader options, constructor, and extension-set assembly.

## Resume oversized sessions into required compaction (2026-09-09)

### What changed

- `sdk.ts` admits only restored sessions whose projection remains unusable after the compaction-eligible resume branch, when compaction is enabled; `agent-session.ts` publishes that projection through the existing session event stream and forces compaction before the first provider prompt. Startup and model-switch assertions are unchanged.

### Why

- A restored transcript can fit the raw context window while system prompt, tool schemas, and output reserve make the first provider request fail. Deferring that admission lets the existing required-compaction route reduce the transcript instead of crashing the constructor.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The projection is evaluated before extensions are wired, so only core can retain the shortfall and defer provider admission.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM in `sdk.ts` startup admission and `agent-session.ts` pre-provider compaction gate; LOW in the interactive event switch.
## Size-adaptive summarization duration budget setting (2026-09-08)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/compaction-settings.ts`, `compaction-settings-access.ts`, and `compaction-settings-resolver.ts`: new optional `compaction.summarizationMaxDurationMs` setting resolving to a positive finite number or `undefined` (adaptive default).

### Why

- Large sessions deadlock on compaction when the fixed 120s summarization watchdog outlives slow providers (#1068); the setting is the user-facing escape hatch over the size-adaptive default.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The settings contract is consumed by core compaction execution before extension hooks run.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the three settings files' `CompactionSettings` / `ResolvedCompactionSettings` shapes.

## Same-model recovery for a native tool-search 400 (2026-09-08)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the hard-error fallback branch first consumes the session's pending native tool-search injection failure (`_takeNativeToolSearchInjectionFailure`). When present, it skips `tryFallback()` and runs the shared retry scheduling (zero-delay `auto_retry_start`, failed-message removal, continuation) on the SAME model — the adapter is already disabled for the session, so the next attempt succeeds in place and the user is not demoted to a weaker model. The pending flag is consumed once, so a second rejection takes the ordinary hard-error chain.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/retry-fallback-hard-error.test.ts`: two cases pin the contract — one same-model retry with no `retry_fallback_applied` events, and a normal fallback switch on the second consecutive 400.

### Why

- A native tool-search 400 hard-errored the model and the hard-error branch always switched to the next fallback candidate (`RetryFallbackController` intentionally excludes the current model), demoting the user mid-task even though the same model succeeds once native injection is off (senpi #1482).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- No hook exists at the fallback-decision point; the retry branch is session-owned. The extension can only record that its own request was rejected (the pending flag on the provider-scoped `ToolSearchService`) — consuming it must happen in the session.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: the `hardErrorFallback` branch and retry-delay computation in `agent-session.ts` (fork-heavy area); LOW: the suite test additions.

## GPT-6 Astra high-reasoning warning parity (2026-09-08)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/high-reasoning-warning.ts`: include GPT-6 Astra variants in the existing Sol warning policy, retaining the xhigh/max threshold and shared warning content.

### Why

- Astra users need the same excessive-reasoning warning as Sol users at the same effort levels.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The shared core predicate controls warning events for model and thinking-level changes across CLI surfaces.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the model-id matcher in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/high-reasoning-warning.ts`.

## Goal backstop default is 270s (2026-09-08)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `getPromptCacheGoalBackstopMaxSeconds()` falls back to 270 instead of 3570.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-shapes.ts`: `PromptCacheSettings.goalBackstopMaxSeconds` documents the 270 default.

### Why

- The goal monitor's backstop is the floor under the event-driven drain fire; a wake source that never delivers (a misconfigured monitor filter, an endless stream) must not park a goal for an hour. See `extensions/builtin/goal/changes.md` (2026-09-08).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The default lives in core settings resolution and the extension runner's fallback, not in extension code.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the two literal defaults above.

## The session request carries its effective service tier without an extension (2026-09-08)

### What changed

- Tracks code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#6795.

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: the Agent `streamFn` sets `serviceTier` on the stream options when the caller did not: the session's `effectiveServiceTier` for the active model (catalog `-fast` variant, scoped `:priority` pin, or session fast mode), else the request model's own catalog tier for side requests (title/branch summaries). Only APIs that accept `service_tier` (`supportsServiceTier`) receive it. The late-bound session ref used by the Cursor exec bridge is now the shared `sessionRef`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: hands `getEffectiveServiceTier` to the extension runner.

### Why

- A `-fast` catalog variant (`openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna-fast`) declares `serviceTier: "priority"`, and `ModelRuntime.prepareRequest` already honors its sibling field `upstreamModelId`, yet the tier itself reached the wire only through the builtin service-tier extension's payload hook. Sessions created without builtin extensions - SDK embedders, oh-my-openagent's in-process delegated children - silently ran at the standard tier while displaying a fast model. The extension keeps its per-model memory role; its hook only fills a missing field, so both paths agree.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The affected sessions load no extensions by construction; the request-side default has to live in the session's own stream function.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `streamFn` option literal and the session ref in `sdk.ts`; the runner context-actions literal in `agent-session.ts`.

## Insufficient accepted compaction keeps its blocked state, #7921 case 6 (2026-09-07)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_blockedPostCompactionAssistant` now records the byte-derived context size at the moment it arms (`_blockedAdmissionContentTokens`) instead of a message revision. `_incrementMessageRevision` no longer clears it; `_releaseBlockedPostCompactionAdmissionIfReduced` releases it only when the context actually shrank, and `compact()` releases it unconditionally as the user's explicit remedy. The admission guard in `_enforceCompactionBeforeProvider` matches on the blocked assistant alone.

### Why

- code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#7921 case 6: an accepted compaction whose summary left the context over budget blocked the session, but any synthetic revision bump - a model or settings change, a queue mutation, an extension continuation, a scheduled retry - cleared the block, and the automatic continuation retried the unchanged oversized context, paying for another doomed compaction each time. Queued data was kept but the work was wasted.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The blocked state is core admission bookkeeping; no extension observes the revision counter or the admission guard.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `_blockedPostCompactionAssistant` declaration, `_incrementMessageRevision`, the two arming sites in `_checkCompaction`, and the guard at the head of `_enforceCompactionBeforeProvider`.

## Final admission revalidates late content, #7921 case 5 (2026-09-07)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_enforceFinalProviderAdmission` projects pending steering and follow-up input (`_pendingQueuedInputMessages`) alongside the turn-local messages it was handed, re-reading the queues on every oversize sample so a compaction retry measures whatever arrived meanwhile. It also now runs when late queued input exists rather than only when a `custom` message is present, and resolves its reserve through `resolveEffectiveReserveTokens` instead of an inline copy of the scaling rule.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the stale-usage exemption is narrowed to the usage number itself. `_getAutoCompactionReason` and the automatic route of `_checkCompaction` still ignore a provider usage figure measured before the accepted compaction boundary, but no longer exempt the messages: when the byte-derived estimate of the current context already exceeds the policy (`_exceedsPolicyByContentEstimate`), the threshold decision proceeds on that estimate. The inline pre-prompt route is unchanged because `_enforceCompactionBeforeProvider` already re-samples and owns that rejection.

### Why

- code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#7921 case 5: oversized steering queued after the projection was assembled rode into the first provider request of the turn, and a large fresh tool result appended after an accepted compaction was skipped entirely because the last usage message predated the boundary - a context measured at 80,000 tokens against a 10,000-token window reported no compaction reason at all.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Both gates are core admission: the final projection is assembled in `AgentSession` after the last extension hook has returned, and the stale-usage exemption is core's own accounting rule.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `_enforceFinalProviderAdmission`, `_getAutoCompactionReason`, and the threshold branch of `_checkCompaction`.

## Automatic continuations pass the proactive compaction policy, #7921 case 4 (2026-09-07)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_revalidateScheduledContinuationAdmission` now samples the shared proactive predicate (`shouldTriggerCompaction`) in addition to the hard-reserve valve (`shouldCompact`), so a scheduled continuation compacts at the same usage an explicit user prompt does. Proactive pressure alone never rejects the continuation: only the hard-reserve case still throws `RequiredCompactionError`.

### Why

- code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#7921 case 4: the proactive threshold lives in the compaction extension's `before_agent_start`, which automatic continuations (tool-result continuations, queued follow-up/steer drained at `agent_end`) never emit. A continuation above the threshold but below the hard limit reached the provider uncompacted while a user prompt at identical usage compacted first.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Automatic continuations bypass `before_agent_start` entirely, so no extension handler observes them. This is the single core choke point every scheduled continuation passes before the provider.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the body of `_revalidateScheduledContinuationAdmission` and the `builtin/compaction/policy.ts` import line.

## Workspace trust keys resolve strictly (2026-09-07)

### What changed

- `trust-manager.ts`: `normalizeCwd` resolves through `canonicalizePathStrict` and falls back to the resolved-but-unconfirmed path only when the filesystem will not confirm it, instead of silently accepting whatever `canonicalizePath` handed back.

### Why

- Trust keys are compared as strings, so a path the filesystem never confirmed could be keyed by its raw spelling and inherit a decision recorded for a different directory that merely writes the same way. Resolving strictly makes the unconfirmed case explicit; because no stored key can match a location the kernel does not agree on, the effect is that the user is asked again rather than inheriting. This also retires keys written by the previous path-collapsing resolver: they no longer match, so they no longer grant trust.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Trust is resolved before extensions load and gates whether project resources may be read at all, so nothing downstream can re-key or revoke a decision the store has already returned.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the body of `normalizeCwd` and the `../utils/paths.ts` import line.

### What changed

- `src/core/package-identity.ts`: `findNearestPackageIdentity` and `dedupePathsByPackageIdentity` moved out of the resource loader as pure functions (nearest `package.json` name + relative resource path).
- `src/core/resource-loader.ts`: skill paths assembled during `reload()` are deduped by package identity the same way extension paths already were, so a second physical copy of one package contributes no skills and no collision diagnostics.

### Why

- omo-ai loads its plugin via `--extension`; when `settings.packages` also held a worktree checkout of `@code-yeongyu/omo-senpi`, extensions deduped by package name but every one of the 24 skills raised a "name collision" warning at startup. Skills and extensions from one package identity now follow one rule: the earliest registration wins.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Skill discovery and collision diagnostics run in the core loader before any extension code executes.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `resource-loader.ts` around skill path assembly and the former private package-identity helpers.


## 2026-09-07 - Dedupe skills from duplicate copies of one package

## 2026-09-07 - Overflow recovery outlives the auto-compaction flag; session-scoped toggle (#1422)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_getAutoCompactionReason` and `_checkCompaction` gate only the threshold path on `compaction.enabled`; a turn that `isTurnStuckOnContextOverflow` (new `core/compaction/stuck-overflow.ts`) still runs the one-shot overflow recovery. Silent overflow on a completed answer and truncated `length` stops stay under the flag.
- `AgentSession.setAutoCompactionEnabled` stores a session override instead of calling `SettingsManager.setCompactionEnabled`; every compaction read (`_getCompactionSettings`) and the extension context's `getCompactionSettings` observe it, and `autoCompactionEnabled` reports it. The interactive `/settings` toggle persists through the settings manager itself.

### Why

- Session `01a07542` (gpt-6-astra) died at 916,628 prompt tokens with zero compactions: OmO Desktop's per-thread toggle had persisted `compaction.enabled=false` machine-wide through the RPC command, and that one flag also switched off provider-overflow recovery, so nothing could shrink the context automatically.

### Why this lives in the fork

- Compaction admission and the settings toggle are `AgentSession` internals below the extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `_getAutoCompactionReason`, `_checkCompaction`, and the `setAutoCompactionEnabled`/`autoCompactionEnabled` pair in `agent-session.ts`; every `settingsManager.getCompactionSettings()` read there now goes through `_getCompactionSettings()`.

## 2026-09-05 - Persist Astra reasoning configuration updates

### What changed

- packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts: write and re-anchor Astra configuration updates during thinking changes and compaction.
- packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/compaction.ts: preserve the configuration-update role during compaction.
- packages/coding-agent/src/core/messages.ts: project durable entries into the configuration-update message role.
- packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts: restore the reasoning baseline from session state.
- packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts: persist and replay configuration-update entries.

### Why

- Changing GPT-6 Astra reasoning through the request-level field breaks the prompt-cache prefix; the Responses API provides a positional configuration-update item for this transition.

### Why this lives in the fork

- Session lifecycle, compaction, and provider context assembly are core paths below extension interception.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- Agent-session thinking-level transitions, session-manager context assembly, and compaction lifecycle.

## 2026-09-05 - Persist Astra reasoning configuration updates

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/messages.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`, and core compaction paths persist and replay Astra configuration-update messages at their original positions, pin the request baseline, and re-anchor after compaction.

### Why

- Changing GPT-6 Astra reasoning through the request-level field breaks the prompt-cache prefix; the Responses API provides a positional configuration-update item for this transition.

### Why this lives in the fork

- Session lifecycle, compaction, and provider context assembly are core paths below extension interception.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- Agent-session thinking-level transitions, session-manager context assembly, and compaction lifecycle.

# changes

## 2026-09-19 - Run before_agent_start for idle custom trigger turns (#1329)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` routes an idle `sendCustomMessage(..., { triggerTurn: true })` through `before_agent_start` after core pre-provider compaction and before final provider admission. Hook custom messages and system-prompt overrides use the same application path as ordinary prompts. A user abort while an awaited hook is held prevents a ghost provider turn and retains the trigger in its selected queue. The branch holds the session-work barrier for the whole awaited admission span, the way `prompt()` does: a trigger turn sent from `agent_settled` (the ttsr nudge) otherwise races the settling run's own continuation and the recovery turn is lost (`goal-ttsr-user-abort-race.test.ts`).

### Why

- Under a goal loop every turn is such a trigger turn, so the compaction extension's proactive policy (`threshold_trigger`, warm-summary consumption, speculative lead) never ran: sessions rode from the proactive threshold to the hard reserve valve and then paid a from-scratch blocking summarization inside the turn, which surfaced as minutes of `Compacting...` (evidence on #1329).
- Extension-triggered turns bypassed `before_agent_start`, so hook-provided context and system-prompt changes were absent from their actual provider request. Awaiting the newly-added hook also created an abort window where a released hook could start a turn after the user cancelled it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The idle trigger-turn branch chooses provider admission, cancellation ownership, and invokes the agent loop inside `AgentSession`; extensions only receive the lifecycle hook after the host emits it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `sendCustomMessage` trigger-turn admission, cancellation generation, and the shared `before_agent_start` result application in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-08 - Reserve session writers before opening or replacing them

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-write-reservation.ts` provides an isolate-local synchronous ownership-grant seam, installed only by shared-host workers.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` obtains that grant before opening, normalizing, rewriting, appending, creating, or branching a durable session file.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts` reserves an import destination before copying into it.

### Why

- Alias collisions and session replacements must not open competing writers and resolve ownership afterward. A timed-out worker can still return from a syscall, so ownership remains reserved until its actual exit.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Writer creation and append-side repair in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`, and copying in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`, occur below extension lifecycle hooks.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` constructor/set-file, persistence, new/fork, and static open seams; LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts` import-copy ordering and the additive reservation module.

## 2026-09-06 - Preserve fallback decision logs across atomic admission

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/controller.ts`: separates fallback decision logging from candidate reservation, so actual fallback attempts still record `no_chain` and `candidates_exhausted` without reserving a candidate before context admission succeeds.

### Why

- The atomic admission fix correctly moved reservation until after model admission, but also suppressed the diagnostic logger on the same probe path. That removed the only durable fallback decision observable and caused `fallback.log` to disappear for no-chain and exhausted-chain decisions.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Candidate reservation and fallback decision logging are private retry-controller state and lifecycle behavior below the extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `RetryFallbackController.tryFallback` and `nextCandidate` decision handling.

## 2026-09-06 - Preserve inline skill anchors in composed prompts

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` preserves known inline `$skill:name` references as readable `[skill: name]` anchors when composing the expanded user request.

### Why

- Inline skill expansion previously removed the token entirely, leaving a sentence hole and losing the user's explicit reference in the composed prompt.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Skill invocation token removal and prompt composition are core `AgentSession` behavior below the extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `removeSkillInvocationTokens` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-05 - Require explicit fallback chains

### What changed

- Removed shipped Fable defaults and wildcard fallback resolution; fallback runs only for configured model keys. Cursor remains excluded from bare expansion while explicit Cursor selection remains supported.

### Why

- Implicit fallback can unexpectedly change the selected model and mishandles Astra variants when no chain was configured.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Retry fallback chain resolution is a core controller and settings contract.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: retry-fallback chains, settings, and controller.

## 2026-09-05 - Ctrl+P skips favorites without context room

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts` uses the existing `projectModelUsabilityBudget` projection
  before favorite-model cycling, emits `model_change_skipped` for rejected
  candidates, and continues in the requested direction. The cycle result
  carries skipped models when every alternative is rejected.
- Skipping requires somewhere to skip TO: when the rotation holds several
  alternatives and all are rejected, the cycle reports the skipped list and
  stays on the current model, but a lone rejected alternative is an explicit
  switch request and still raises `ModelUsabilityBudgetError` as it did before
  candidate skipping existed.

### Why

- An explicit Ctrl+P switch request must skip a model that cannot admit the
  current context instead of reaching the later usability assertion and
  surfacing a failed switch.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Favorite cycling and the session event stream are core runtime seams below the
  extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `AgentSessionEvent` union and `_cycleFavoriteModel` in
  `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-09-04 - File-storage locks wait through contention

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/lockfile-policy.ts`: `FILE_STORAGE_LOCK_OPTIONS` gains a bounded proper-lockfile retry schedule (8 retries, factor 2, 100ms..1,000ms, ~5.5s total = `FILE_STORAGE_LOCK_RETRY_BUDGET_MS`) under the unchanged 30s stale / 10s update window; a separate `FILE_STORAGE_SYNC_LOCK_BUDGET_MS = 1_000` bounds main-thread waiters; exhausted `ELOCKED` becomes `CredentialStoreBusyError` carrying the lock path and elapsed wait, and `isLockError()` centralises the ELOCKED test.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/state-store.ts`: `withDocument` acquires through its own bounded wait loop (same schedule and budget as the auth store) instead of a single `lockfile.lock` call, and surfaces exhaustion as `CredentialStoreBusyError`. A single-shot acquire under the shared `retries: 0` policy died on the first contender, which is the omo#7748 failure itself.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`: the async auth lock keeps its OWN retry loop (proper-lockfile acquires with `retries: 0`) but bounds it with `FILE_STORAGE_LOCK_RETRY_BUDGET_MS`; delegating to proper-lockfile's internal `retries` was rejected because an `AbortSignal` would then only be observed after the whole 5.5s wait and `onCompromised` would not be rebound per attempt. The sync path replaces the fixed 10 x 20ms spin with the shared 100/200/400ms Atomics.wait schedule truncated to the 1s sync budget.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: the sync settings lock adopts the same 1s sync schedule and error type.

### Why

- On `claude-sdk-oauth`, `refreshSlot()` took the credential-pool lock with no retries, so any concurrent omo process sharing `~/.omo` made the turn die with the bare `Lock file is already being held` and burn the fallback chain (oh-my-openagent#7748). Contention is infrastructure, not a provider failure: it must be waited out and, when exhausted, reported as a typed transient error.
- Sync callers block the TUI main thread; Atomics.wait removed the CPU spin (#1056) but not the freeze, so their budget stays short (1s) while async refreshers may wait ~5.5s.
- Stale-lock recovery stays with proper-lockfile; its ownership-unsafe recovery/release sequences remain the documented residual risk and this change does not fork the library.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The locks are taken inside core storage backends (`auth-storage.ts`, `settings-manager.ts`, `credential-pool/state-store.ts`) below the extension boundary; no hook runs between `lockfile.lock` and the caller.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `lockfile-policy.ts` constants block.
- LOW: the lock-acquire helpers in `auth-storage.ts`, `settings-manager.ts`, `credential-pool/state-store.ts`.
## 2026-09-04 - Adopt the v0.84.4 core runtime fixes

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`: an in-memory fork tears down the current runtime before creating the forked or branched session and links the new session's parent to the pre-fork leaf, so the active turn settles before the fork target exists (upstream 56c6fb33c, #8937).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/http-dispatcher.ts`: the environment proxy agent sets `proxyTunnel` to keep HTTP origins on CONNECT tunnels as they behaved before Undici 8.7 (upstream 23842b1e6, #8134).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts`: the models.json compat schemas gain optional `vllmPriority` (openai-completions), `supportsMaxOutputTokens` (openai-responses), and `supportsMidConvoEffort` (anthropic-messages) fields.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: opening an existing session file for append appends a newline when the file does not end with one, repairing an unterminated JSONL tail from the append-owning process only and never from read-only loads (upstream 0b5ee5d8b, #8345).

### Why

- Settling the turn before the fork target exists keeps the forked session from observing a half-written parent; without the tunnel flag proxied HTTP requests lost their origin after the Undici 8.7 behavior change; the compat flags expose provider capabilities the sync's provider clients now read; and a torn tail entry otherwise fuses with the next append and can swallow the rest of the session.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session file ownership, runtime teardown ordering, the HTTP dispatcher, and the models.json schema are core seams that run before or below extension hooks.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` append-side repair and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts` fork ordering; LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts` compat schema fields and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/http-dispatcher.ts` agent options.

## 2026-09-04 - Skills prompt aliases each root to a short rN prefix

### What changed

- `skills.ts` `formatSkillsForPrompt`: emits a `<skill_roots></skill_roots>` table (one line per distinct root, `r0`, `r1`, ...) and renders each `<location>` as `alias/<name>/SKILL.md` plus a one-line expansion rule. `test/suite/skills-root-alias.test.ts` covers the table, alias re-join resolvability, and the character saving; `test/skills.test.ts` re-pins the location shape.

### Why

- The long absolute root was billed once per skill (145 skills): 23,381 -> 22,244 o200k tokens (-1,137) on the real set with no content removed.

### Why an extension could not handle this differently

- `skills.ts` owns the single renderer for the skills section; there is no extension seam for its formatting.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `skills.ts` renderer body and `skills.test.ts` location assertion.


## 2026-09-04 - Route bare "." submissions through a hidden manual-continue directive

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/manual-continue.ts` (new): `MANUAL_CONTINUE_CUSTOM_TYPE` (`"manual-continue"`) and `MANUAL_CONTINUE_DIRECTIVE`, the `<system-notice>` continue directive (resume most recent intent, complete unfinished work, resume where interrupted, never pause to summarize/re-confirm/ask).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `prompt()` now intercepts `text.trim() === "."` on a session that already has messages BEFORE the extension input event is emitted. Instead of creating, persisting, or echoing a user message, it routes the directive through the existing `sendCustomMessage` path (custom message, `display: false`): `triggerTurn` starts a turn when idle, `steer`/`followUp` deliver while streaming (mapping `options.streamingBehavior`). The submission resolves as `promptDisposition("handled")` + `preflightResult(true)` so the interactive optimistic echo is cleared. An empty session, or a `.` submitted with image attachments (the user is sending the images, not asking to continue), falls through to ordinary prompt handling.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/manual-continue-shortcut.test.ts` (new): pins the idle-turn, streaming-steer, and empty-session-fallthrough behaviors plus the echo disposition contract.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/pre-prompt-compaction-no-continue.test.ts`: the "dot retry" case now asserts the hidden `manual-continue` custom message instead of a literal `.` user message (the regression's subject — pre-prompt overflow compaction without `agent.continue()` — is unchanged and still covered).
- `packages/coding-agent/docs/usage.md` + `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md`: one-line shortcut documentation and the `[Unreleased]` Added bullet.

### Why

- oh-my-pi maps `.`/`c` to a hidden agent-authored continue message so a one-keystroke nudge resumes the prior intent instead of second-guessing the interrupt. senpi had no equivalent: a bare `.` became a literal user turn ("." as prose), and the model would answer the punctuation rather than continue. senpi has no `developer` role; the equivalent hidden primitive is a custom message with `display: false`, which `convertToLlm` maps to a user-role directive for the provider.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The shortcut must suppress user-message creation, persistence, and the optimistic echo inside `prompt()` itself, before the extension input event fires; an extension `input` handler can transform or handle text but cannot retroactively un-create the canonical user message or clear the TUI echo. The turn-driving primitive (`sendCustomMessage` with trigger/steer semantics and session-work serialization) is core session machinery.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` — the top of `prompt()`'s `try` block (before the extension input emission), where queue-admission branches frequently change.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/manual-continue.ts` (new file, no conflicts).
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/pre-prompt-compaction-no-continue.test.ts` — the single assertion swap in the "dot retry" case.


## 2026-09-04 - Failed provider turns leave the LLM context on every lane

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/messages.ts`: `convertToLlm` runs the shared `dropFailedAssistantTurns` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` as its final step, removing assistant turns with `stopReason` `error`/`aborted` and the tool results orphaned by that drop from the returned `Message[]`. `convertToLlmForTransport` inherits the drop through `convertToLlm`.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/convert-to-llm-drops-failed-turns.test.ts` (new): `convertToLlm` on `[user, assistant(error, "PARTIAL" + toolCall), toolResult, user]` yields no `PARTIAL` text and no orphaned tool call; same for an aborted turn.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/anthropic-subscription-prompt-bridge.test.ts`: regression pinning that `buildPromptBlocks` over `convertToLlm`-processed history renders no failed-turn text and no orphaned tool call id.

### Why

- The claude-sdk-oauth prompt bridge (`buildPromptBlocks`) rendered every history assistant into `<conversation_history>` with no `stopReason` filter, so a failed provider turn's partial text and unexecuted tool calls were replayed to the SDK on every subsequent request; `estimateContextTokens(buildSessionContext(...))` counted the failed turns as live tokens. The provider transform layer already dropped them for pi-ai APIs only, leaving these two lanes and token estimation exposed.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Both lanes consume `convertToLlm` output directly inside core request building (`prompt-bridge.ts`, cursor turn building, token estimation); no extension seam sits between the session message list and those builders.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the tail of `convertToLlm` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/messages.ts` (the new `dropFailedAssistantTurns` return).
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/test/anthropic-subscription-prompt-bridge.test.ts` (one new `it` before the stream test).

## 2026-09-04 - Restore the selected model, not its upstream wire id, on resume

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `getSessionContextSettings()` now treats an
  explicit selection (a manual `model_change`, or the primary model restored from a fallback window)
  as authoritative over later assistant messages from the same provider. An assistant message only
  redefines the restored model when no explicit selection is in force or when it comes from a
  different provider, which preserves legacy assistant-only sessions and the existing fallback
  window handling.

### Why

- A catalog entry that maps to an `upstreamModelId` (the `-fast` priority variants, e.g.
  `quotio-openai/gpt-5.6-sol-fast` -> `gpt-5.6-sol`) persists the upstream id on every assistant
  message, because the request went out with that id. The old restore let that echo overwrite the
  recorded selection, so resuming the session came back on the base model with no priority tier:
  the fast indicator was gone and `service_tier` left the wire. Regression:
  `test/session-manager/upstream-model-id-restore.test.ts`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Model restoration happens inside `SessionManager.buildSessionContext()` before the session or any
  extension exists; `session_start` observes the already-resolved (wrong) model.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `model` bookkeeping inside `getSessionContextSettings()` in `session-manager.ts`.


## 2026-09-04 - Gate next-turn compaction on real provider admission

### What changed

- Keep the next-turn callback running every completed turn, but enforce compaction only when a tool continuation or queued message will be admitted to a provider; retain the late queue re-sample and one bounded callback replay after compaction.

### Why

- Restoring the every-turn preparation contract must not reintroduce compaction on a completed turn that has no provider continuation, while queued work arriving during preparation still needs a consistent compacted context.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Compaction admission, queue ownership, and callback replay span AgentSession persistence and provider lifecycle state beneath the extension event surface.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` next-turn preparation and compaction admission around `_installAgentNextTurnRefresh`.

## 2026-09-03 - Restore provider-level api inheritance for models.json models

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts` composes models.json custom models with a defaults object that always carries the extension-registered provider's `api` and `baseUrl`, so a definition that omits both still inherits them when no built-in default exists; upstream's api-aware `findModelDefaults` remains the built-in lookup, and the missing-api/missing-baseUrl errors are unchanged when neither source provides a value.

### Why

- The upstream sync kept `findModelDefaults` but gated the extension fallback behind a truthy defaults check, so a models.json model under an extension-registered provider with an empty base catalog failed composition with `no "api" specified` before the extension layer could run.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Provider composition order and models.json merging happen inside `applyModelsJson`/`modelFromJson` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`, before extension model behavior can repair the intermediate layer.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: models.json model upsert loop in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts` (`applyModelsJson`), plus the `modelFromJson` defaults parameter type.

## 2026-09-03 - Route required compaction failures through admission state

### What changed

- Preserved the RequiredCompactionError turn/admission markers used to convert asynchronous compaction rejection into a controlled prompt error.

### Why

- Required compaction must reject the originating prompt without escaping as an unhandled event-queue rejection.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Admission state is owned by AgentSession and spans agent event persistence, retry, and compaction scheduling.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` compaction admission and `_processAgentEvent` handling.

## 2026-09-03 - Bridge branded terminal capability overrides

### What changed

- `settings-manager.ts` resolves unset terminal hyperlink, image-protocol, and truecolor settings from `SENPI_*` environment variables, falling back to the legacy `PI_*` names through the brand environment helper.

### Why

- Branded Senpi launches need terminal capability overrides to reach the shared TUI detection path without duplicating environment-resolution policy.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Settings resolution occurs before interactive rendering and is core-owned configuration behavior outside extension hooks.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `settings-manager.ts` terminal capability override resolution.

## 2026-09-03 - Make eval-only tool routing unconditional and registry-aware

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: replaces the settings-gated bash/workflow policy with the fixed eval-only set `bash`, `powershell`, `workflow`, and `monitor`; keeps SDK overrides, routes monitor guidance through its required `description` and command fields, filters prompt/hint names to the session registry, and preserves reload resolution and hint withdrawal.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: removes the deleted `experimental.bashEvalOnly` and `experimental.workflowEvalOnly` settings and getters while retaining `experimental.sharedHost`.

### Why

- Eval is the execution boundary for shell, workflow, and monitor operations whenever the registry provides it, so a settings key could disable the intended default and stale `powershell` guidance could reach macOS sessions that cannot provide that tool.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Active-tool withholding, registry-backed execution, removed-tool hints, and system-prompt assembly are coordinated inside `AgentSession` before extension code can atomically enforce the policy; settings schema and getters are core load-time behavior.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` around eval-only policy constants, hint publication, prompt suffix assembly, tool registry refresh, and reload.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` around `ExperimentalSettings` and the experimental getter block.

## 2026-09-02 - Provider stream-start default raised to 300s for slow thinking models

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `DEFAULT_STREAM_START_TIMEOUT_MS` goes from 90_000 to 300_000, so the default provider stream-start watchdog grants 300s for the first SSE event. The effective value is still `min(default, idle timeout)`, explicit `retry.provider.streamStartTimeoutMs` overrides win unchanged, and `0` still disables the watchdog.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `getRetrySettings()` now defaults `maxRetries` to 5 instead of 3, matching `SENPI_DEFAULT_RETRY_PROFILE.turn.maxRetries`. Without this the one `retry.maxRetries` key meant 5 on the turn stage but 3 on every `getRetrySettings()` consumer (session-title retry, compaction summarization retry, the agent-session retry gate), and the documented default could only be true for one of them.
- `packages/coding-agent/docs/settings.md`: the defaults table and the JSON example track the new default.

### Why

- Opus/Fable-class models with xhigh thinking routinely take longer than 90s to emit the first stream event, so the old default aborted healthy requests (`Provider stream start timed out after 90000ms`) and support had to tell users to raise the timeout by hand. Every comparable harness already grants 300s here (opencode's header timeout, codex's stream idle timeout, oh-my-pi's first-event timeout), and senpi's own stream idle default is already 300s.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The value is a shipped core constant that applies only when no explicit setting exists; extensions can set `retry.provider.streamStartTimeoutMs` per session but cannot change the unset default every session inherits.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the two default lines in `settings-manager.ts` (`DEFAULT_STREAM_START_TIMEOUT_MS`, the `getRetrySettings()` fallback) plus the matching rows in `docs/settings.md`.

## 2026-09-02 - Inherit extension provider settings for models.json custom models

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts` now lets models.json custom models inherit an extension-registered provider's `api` and `baseUrl`, and preserves extension catalog models when adding new custom IDs.

### Why

- A custom models.json model under an extension provider previously failed before the extension could compose it because the models.json layer could not see the extension's provider-level settings; models.json custom definitions not declared by the extension catalog were also dropped.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Provider composition order and models.json merging are core responsibilities in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`, before extension model behavior can repair the intermediate layer.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: models.json and extension composition in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`.

## 2026-09-02 - Name the retry stream-start setting

### What changed

- Provider retry continuation watchdog abort messages now name `retry.provider.streamStartTimeoutMs` and explain that `0` disables the guard.

### Why

- Users need an actionable setting name when a retry continuation watchdog reports a provider stream-start stall.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The watchdog is owned by `AgentSession` and aborts the core agent directly, before extension hooks can rewrite the error.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `agent-session.ts` retry watchdog abort message builder.

## 2026-08-31 - Session activity contract for host occupancy decisions

### What changed

- `session-activity.ts` (new): the single definition of session-owned activity - `SessionActivitySnapshot` (agent run, bash, compaction, session-work barrier), `WakeSourceTracker` for extension-published `wake_source_state` counts, and the `isSessionBusySnapshot()` predicate composing them.
- `agent-session.ts`: `AgentSession` exposes `activitySnapshot` and `isSessionBusy`, and subscribes to `wake_source_state` on every extension bind so background terminal jobs, terminal monitors, and loop-guard holds count as live work; the subscription is dropped on dispose and counts deliberately survive an extension reload.
- `extensions/runner.ts`: `onBusEvent(channel, handler)` exposes the session's extension event bus for those activity signals, alongside the existing `onRpcEvent`.

### Why

- The shared RPC host's idle eviction asked only `isStreaming`/`isBashRunning`, so a session whose work outlives the turn - an auto-detached background terminal job, a running compaction, or barrier-held continuation work - could be torn down at the idle threshold, killing the user's job. Teardown decisions now consult one composed predicate, so a future activity source is picked up by every call site at once instead of being missed per call site.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The predicate is consumed by host lifecycle code beneath every extension surface, and it must aggregate in-session state (`_isAgentRunActive`, the compaction lifecycle, the session-work barrier) that no extension can observe.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the new `session-activity.ts` module, the activity getters and `_bindExtensionCore` subscription in `agent-session.ts`, and the `onBusEvent` helper in `extensions/runner.ts`.

## 2026-08-31 - Release refusal fallback pins on compaction

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/controller.ts` records pin provenance and exposes `notifyCompactionApplied` to release refusal-caused pin contributions.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` calls `_onCompactionContextChanged` at the `_executeCompaction` success seam and eagerly restores the original model; billing pins and `fallbackRevertPolicy "never"` are unaffected, and there is no new settings key.

### Why

- Refusal pins encode "same context refuses again"; compaction rewrites the context, so one fresh primary attempt per successful apply is correct. This is always-on by user decision, with no config key.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The pin state and restore gate live inside core retry-fallback controller state and the agent-session compaction apply seam. Extensions observe compaction events but cannot mutate `ActiveFallbackState` or re-enter the internal restore gate.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The prepend zone at the top of `packages/coding-agent/src/core/changes.md`.
- The `tryFallback` state-write hunk in `retry-fallback/controller.ts`.
- The `_executeCompaction` success tail in `agent-session.ts` (near other compaction-lifecycle work).

## 2026-08-31 - Bound the session manager's in-memory mirror

### What changed

- `session-resident-store.ts` now evicts oldest externalized strings above a conservative 64 MiB per-session budget.
- `session-manager.ts` trims superseded pre-compaction entries from its live mirror and reloads the JSONL when a pruned branch is selected.

### Why

- The JSONL is the source of truth; retaining every serialized tool result and historical entry in RAM caused active sessions to grow without bound.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session persistence, compaction, branching, and the resident mirror are core `SessionManager` responsibilities below the extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: resident string storage and `appendCompaction()` mirror maintenance.
## 2026-08-31 - Shared session host is OFF by default (opt-in)

- Interactive sessions no longer join the shared RPC host implicitly. `main.ts` now gates
  `createInteractiveHostRuntime` on `shouldJoinSharedHost()` (`core/shared-host-policy.ts`): a bare
  interactive session stays purely local and never opens `<agentDir>/rpc/rpc.sock`.
- Opt in persistently with the `experimental.sharedHost` setting, or per-process with the
  brand-prefixed `ENABLE_SHARED_HOST` env flag (`SENPI_ENABLE_SHARED_HOST=1` / `OMO_ENABLE_SHARED_HOST=1`) (`SettingsManager.getExperimentalSharedHost()`). Non-interactive
  modes (print, json, rpc, app-server) are unaffected; the app-server / `--multi-session` host owns
  its own transport.
- The former opt-out `DISABLE_SHARED_HOST` is obsolete: it is now the default, and setting it prints a
  one-time notice pointing at the opt-in flag.

## 2026-08-30 - Durable entry notifications are rpc-scoped

## 2026-08-30 - Wire ideal compaction execution through AgentSession

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` routes compaction through the ideal compaction execution pipeline while preserving the existing session lifecycle and transcript accounting contracts.

### Why

- The feature's compaction policy and execution layers need the session-owned model, settings, and transcript state at the integration boundary.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Compaction dispatch is owned by `AgentSession`, before extension-level behavior can replace the session lifecycle integration.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: compaction dispatch in `agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-08-30 - Do not cancel client work from a binding-time tool change

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `setActiveToolsByName()` calls `abortCompaction()` and `_incrementMessageRevision()` only when the tool change happens outside extension binding, detected through the existing `_extensionBindingPromptReadiness` scope that `bindExtensions()` already maintains.

### Why

- A session replacement responds as soon as the swap is committed and rebinds extensions afterwards, by design: awaiting the bind would deadlock a client whose `session_start` handler blocks on an `extension_ui_request`. During that bind, `session_start` handlers deactivate tools for the active model (`video-in`, `look-at`), the tool set changes, and the abort plus revision bump cancelled a compaction the client had already started against the committed session - "Compaction cancelled" on roughly 4 of 6 runs, verified by capturing the abort stack inside the host process. Tool activation performed while binding is part of the binding, not a mid-session context change, so it must not invalidate that work. Mid-session tool changes still abort and bump exactly as before.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The abort is core session lifecycle beneath the extension API, and the extensions involved are the ones whose binding triggers it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `activeToolNamesChanged` branch in `setActiveToolsByName()`.


## 2026-08-30 - Drop the classic host-UI no-op stub

- `agent-session.ts`: `_emitEntryAppended` only fires while the session is bound in `rpc`
  mode. The notifications exist to hydrate the shared-host RPC proxy mirror; emitting them
  on classic/print streams injected extra labels into the released event-order contract
  (`agent-session-retry-events`, `retry-fallback-engine` pin the full ordered label list and
  the byte-for-byte no-chain retry contract).
- `agent-session-prompt.test.ts` binds `mode: "rpc"` before asserting durable prompt entries,
  so the new-behavior test exercises the lane the contract actually covers instead of the
  default print lane.


## 2026-08-30 - Experimental workflow eval-only policy

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: adds the `experimental.workflowEvalOnly` setting and its getter.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: resolves the policy from settings in the constructor and on reload, hides the `workflow` tool while the registered `eval` tool is present, executes it through the registry without activation, publishes an eval-cell hint, adds system-prompt guidance, and retains the withheld tool so disarming restores direct access.

### Why

- Codemode can keep invoking the workflow (dag) tool from eval cells while preventing it from being advertised as a direct model tool. The policy is inert when codemode's `eval` tool is unavailable, so workflow access is never lost.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Active tool visibility, lazy activation, the wrapped registry, and the agent-loop removed-tool hint map are coordinated inside `AgentSession`; an extension cannot atomically enforce these boundaries.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts`: active-tool selection, tool registry refresh, reload, and system-prompt assembly.
## 2026-08-29 - Bound Cursor serialized tool-result admissions

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: Cursor tool-result request views now use a conservative escaped/enveloped serialization bound and never amplify output with markers.

### Why

- Cursor duplicates history across JSON and protobuf envelopes, and JSON escaping makes raw-byte heuristics unsafe.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- AgentSession owns provider admission and the request-only transform boundary.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`

## 2026-08-29 - Final shared-host bash callback coverage

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/bash-executor.ts`

### Why

- Preserve callback rejection through shared-host cleanup.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Core callback dispatch owns this boundary.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/bash-executor.ts`

## 2026-08-29 - Complete shared-host shell callback propagation

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` now observes asynchronous bash output callbacks and preserves the original callback failure through cleanup.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/interactive-host-runtime.ts` aborts shared-host commands when those callbacks reject and rethrows the original value at the client boundary.

### Why

- The shared-host execution path could otherwise resolve successfully after an asynchronous callback rejection and leave its large-output spill file behind.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The callback is dispatched by the core session and RPC host boundary before extension code can finalize execution cleanup.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: bash callback dispatch in `agent-session.ts` and shared-host execution routing.

## 2026-08-29 - Bound bash callback settlement and cleanup

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/bash-executor.ts` bounds callback settlement on normal completion, reports callback abandonment as an execution error, and clears or unreferences its race timer.

### Why

- A never-settling output callback could hang a command indefinitely or leave a late callback failure and large-output spill unobserved.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Bash callback settlement and spill-file cleanup are owned by the core executor lifecycle before extension code can observe the completed command.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/bash-executor.ts`: callback settlement timeout and final spill cleanup.

## 2026-08-29 - GLM-5.3 model resolver defaults

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: retain the GLM-5.3 Z.AI global and China default model and prompt-preset resolution introduced by this PR.

### Why

- The new Z.AI model family must remain the default for both coding-plan provider variants after synchronizing with upstream changes.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Provider defaults and model-pattern resolution are core resolver behavior that runs before extension hooks.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: provider default mappings and model pattern resolution.

## 2026-08-29 - Make externally owned compaction delegation sticky

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: remember the provider and model id after an automatic compaction is rejected by an external owner, suppressing repeated automatic attempts until that key changes, compaction is accepted, or runtime ownership is reconfigured by reload/registry refresh. Manual compaction remains admitted.
- Added `test/suite/regressions/1174-sticky-delegated-compaction.test.ts` covering repeated turns, manual compaction, and model changes.

### Why

- A provider-owned compaction lane previously caused the core to emit a new automatic compaction attempt on every turn, repeatedly producing rejection events and repainting the same error.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Automatic compaction admission and lifecycle state are private `AgentSession` control flow that runs before extension hooks are emitted.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts`: compaction state, automatic admission methods, rejection handling, model selection invalidation, and tree navigation.

## 2026-08-29 - Experimental bash eval-only policy

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: adds the `experimental.bashEvalOnly` setting and its getter.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: resolves the policy from settings in the constructor and on reload, hides the `bash` and `powershell` tools while the registered `eval` tool is present, executes them through the registry without activation, publishes per-tool eval-cell hints, adds system-prompt guidance, and retains withheld tools so disarming restores direct access.

### Why

- Codemode can keep invoking `bash` and `powershell` from eval cells while preventing those tools from being advertised as direct model tools. The policy is inert when codemode's `eval` tool is unavailable, so shell access is never lost.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Active tool visibility, lazy activation, the wrapped registry, and the agent-loop removed-tool hint map are coordinated inside `AgentSession`; an extension cannot atomically enforce these boundaries.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts`: active-tool selection, tool registry refresh, reload, and system-prompt assembly.

## Compaction settings resolution moved out of the settings manager (2026-08-29)

### What changed

- `settings-manager.ts` delegates compaction knob resolution to `compaction-settings-resolver.ts`
  instead of resolving every field inline. The manager keeps its public accessor shape; the resolver
  owns the defaults for the ideal-pipeline knobs (grace band, tool admission, reminder, reserve
  scaling, speculative lead).

### Why

- `settings-manager.ts` was already well past the module size ceiling. This branch adds compaction
  knobs, and the project rule forbids growing an already-oversized file, so the added resolution
  became its own module.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- These defaults are read by core admission before any extension runs, so they cannot be supplied
  from extension space.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- Upstream changes to `getCompactionSettings` now touch `compaction-settings-resolver.ts` as well as
  `settings-manager.ts`.

## Reject model downswitches that exceed the target budget (2026-08-30)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` adds current live-context usage to the assembled
  model budget before direct or favorite-cycle downswitches. Rejected switches leave the active
  model, persisted session history, and global defaults unchanged.
- The rejection reports every measured budget component and directs callers to compact, revalidate,
  and retry. A successful manual compaction reduces the live projection, so the same explicit switch
  can then be retried normally.

### Why

- A session accumulated under a million-token model could previously commit a 372K model before
  discovering that its live transcript plus prompt, tools, and reserves did not fit. The next turn
  then entered emergency overflow recovery from a model state that was invalid when selected.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Direct and favorite-cycle model selection mutate private session state and persistence before a
  post-selection extension hook runs. Admission must happen at that shared pre-commit boundary.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` around `_setModel`,
  `_cycleFavoriteModel`, and the model-budget assertion.

## Reject models with unusable assembled context budgets (2026-08-30)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` projects the selected model against the current
  assembled system prompt, active tool schemas, output reserve, effective compaction reserve,
  speculation lead, and model-family safety margin before mutating explicit model selection.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts` runs the same projection after `AgentSession` construction,
  when the initial runtime prompt and active tools have been assembled, and rejects setup with the
  projection's precise budget diagnostic when the model is unusable.

### Why

- A small context window can put the fixed speculation lead at or beyond its compaction threshold.
  Accepting that model creates a session with no useful conversation budget and causes permanent
  compaction; setup and explicit selection now fail before provider traffic or model mutation.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session construction and explicit model mutation are core boundaries. Extensions cannot reject
  initial creation after the final prompt/tool assembly or atomically guard every model-selection
  caller before persistence.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` around `_setModel` and the public budget
  assertion used by runtime setup.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts` immediately after `AgentSession` construction.

## Compaction settings resolution moved out of the settings manager (2026-08-29)

### What changed

- `settings-manager.ts` delegates compaction knob resolution to `compaction-settings-resolver.ts`
  instead of resolving every field inline. The manager keeps its public accessor shape; the resolver
  owns the defaults for the ideal-pipeline knobs (grace band, tool admission, reminder, reserve
  scaling, speculative lead).

### Why

- `settings-manager.ts` was already well past the module size ceiling. This branch adds compaction
  knobs, and the project rule forbids growing an already-oversized file, so the added resolution
  became its own module.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- These defaults are read by core admission before any extension runs, so they cannot be supplied
  from extension space.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- Upstream changes to `getCompactionSettings` now touch `compaction-settings-resolver.ts` as well as
  `settings-manager.ts`.

## 2026-08-29 - Withheld tools are filtered at the advertisement seam

Historical entry, superseded by the 2026-09-14 eval-only grep restoration above. The temporary catalog and selection filters described below are removed; the eval-only policy now owns withholding.

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts`: names in `temporarilyDisabledToolNames` are dropped from `definitionRegistry`
  (which becomes `_toolDefinitions`, and therefore the prompt snippets and guidelines) and from the
  DEFAULT `nextActiveToolNames` selection. `_baseToolDefinitions` stays unfiltered, so
  `_toolRegistry` remains whole, and an explicit `activeToolNames` request still activates the tool.

### Why

- Filtering `_baseToolDefinitions` also emptied `_toolRegistry`, which `getRegisteredTool` serves.
  That method is documented to resolve "from the full registry ... independent of the active set"
  precisely because the Cursor exec bridge drives its own native read/bash/grep/ls frames regardless
  of what the request advertised, so every Cursor grep frame would have answered
  `Tool "grep" is not available in this session`. Withholding now happens only where the
  model-facing surface is derived, leaving programmatic name-based resolution working.
- The active-name filter applies to the default selection only. A caller that passes
  `activeToolNames` has named the tool deliberately; overriding that would have broken
  `filesystem-policy`'s contract that policies reach all six built-in file tools, and the
  `defaultTools` explicit-precedence guard.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `_toolDefinitions`, `_toolRegistry`, and the active tool names are private session state built in
  one pass inside `AgentSession`; no extension hook runs between their construction and first use,
  so the split between the advertised surface and the resolvable registry can only be made here.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts`: the historical `definitionRegistry` and `nextActiveToolNames` temporary guards are now deleted. Keep upstream allowlist/exclusion predicates and the declared eval-only policy; do not reintroduce the temporary guards.

- Model runtime credential admission counts the combined canonical environment and policy slot lane, admitting rotation for more than one live slot without acquiring leases during preflight.

## 2026-08-28 - Credential pool parity follow-ups

- Half-open leases now admit their holder exactly once for stored and environment probes.
- Named `models.json` credential slots participate in rotation, policy cooldown bases drive initial backoff,
  full streams preserve session affinity, and account health follows the auth storage directory.
- Bare-family fallback opt-outs normalize provider namespaces, and the shipped `"*"` lane is accepted by validation.

## 2026-08-28 - Wildcard fallback lane for chainless models

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/chains.ts`: added the `WILDCARD_CHAIN_KEY` (`"*"`),
  taught `canonicalizeFallbackChains` to expand and tombstone it (both existing loops skip it because
  it is not a model selector), gave `resolveChainKey` an opt-in `allowWildcard` fallthrough, and added
  `hasExplicitFallbackOptOut` so a `[]` tombstone on the current model's exact/base/bare-family key
  suppresses the lane.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/settings.ts`: `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_CHAINS` ships a `"*"`
  lane mirroring the Fable default rungs.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/controller.ts`: `nextCandidate` resolves in the order
  own chain -> active episode's `chainKey` -> wildcard (gated on the opt-out check).

### Why

- Desktop thread 487d7c29 (2026-08-28) burned nine consecutive turns on upstream 500s from
  `apitopia/kimi-k3-unlocked` with zero fallback attempts and wedged terminal `error`; a manual model
  switch recovered it instantly. `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_CHAINS` only keyed `claude-fable-5`, so the
  manually selected model resolved no chain and `canTryFallback()` was permanently false.
- Ordering is load-bearing: an unconditional wildcard fallthrough hijacked sessions already walking a
  configured chain (their last rung usually has no key either), which the engine suite caught as a
  7 -> 5 call-count regression.
- The opt-out gate exists because canonicalization deletes tombstoned keys, which would otherwise let
  the shipped wildcard silently resurrect fallback for a user who explicitly disabled it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Chain resolution and candidate selection are private `RetryFallbackController` state; extensions see
  fallback events only after the core has already decided not to rotate.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `resolveChainKey` tail and the `canonicalizeFallbackChains` return block in `chains.ts`.
- LOW: the `chainKey` resolution expression in `controller.ts`.

## 2026-08-28 - Credential pool runtime wiring

- Normal simple agent streams now use credential rotation, session ids provide affinity, pinned accounts win selection, expired cooldowns use one half-open probe, successful probes persist health, and custom agent directories scope sidecar state.

## 2026-08-28 - Credential pool final-account removal

- Removing the last stored account now deletes the provider credential instead of leaving stale auth.json data.

## 2026-08-28 - SessionManager reloadFromDisk for external/shared-host mutations

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: added `reloadFromDisk()` to reload `fileEntries`, update internal maps/caches, and rebuild index from `this.sessionFile` if it exists.
- Enables in-process mirrors (such as interactive host proxy) to synchronize with external changes like host-committed compactions.
## 2026-08-27 - Default retry policy phase-2 close-out (docs)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/profile-override.ts`: the `retry.providers.<providerId>` override surface accepts per-provider scheduling-knob overrides validated against `RetryStageOverride` (fields: `enabled`, `maxRetries`, `baseDelayMs`, `growthFactor`, `perAttemptCapMs`, `jitter`, `serverHintMaxDelayMs`). An entire provider entry is rejected atomically when any knob is invalid.
- Recommended settings snippet for users who configure no fallback chain and want a larger same-model budget:
  ```jsonc
  {
    // Raise the turn retry budget for a single-provider setup.
    // maxRetries must be a non-negative safe integer.
    "retry": {
      "providers": {
        "<providerId>": {
          "turn": {
            "maxRetries": 5
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- The default same-model turn retry budget stays at 3 retries. This is an intentional non-change: the budget was reviewed during phase-2 close and kept at its existing value for all providers that don't declare their own profile.
- No new kimi-code observability or telemetry surface was adopted.
- Regression coverage: `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/retry-default-no-kimi-leak.test.ts` guards senpi-default against kimi semantics leaking in (no-hint 429 first-failure fallback, 1258000ms hint tier routing, billing 429 pinned fallback, abort during backoff single `auto_retry_end`).
- Tracked in `packages/ai/src/changes.md` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/changes.md`.

### Why

- Users running a single provider without a fallback chain benefit from a higher retry budget, but the default stays conservative (3) to avoid masking persistent failures when fallback providers are available. The snippet documents the exact override path so users don't have to read the validation source.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `retry.providers` overrides are resolved inside `resolveRetryProfile` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`, before any extension hook. The validation and merge happen at settings load time.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- NONE: doc-only section append; no code files touched.

## Provider-neutral credential accounts (2026-08-27)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-accounts.ts` (new): provider-neutral account surface over the pool slot algebra - `getCredentialAccounts`/`summarizeCredentialAccounts` list stored slots (env slots only when nothing is stored, mirroring resolution precedence), `pinCredentialAccount` pins/unpins, `removeCredentialAccount` removes a stored slot and drops its sidecar health (env-backed accounts refuse removal). Blocked state reads BOTH sources: a slot's own persisted `blockedUntil`/`blockReason` and the pool sidecar. Mutations emit `emitProviderAccountsChanged` so subscribed clients re-read. Summaries carry names and health only, never key material.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/main.ts`: `auth check --json` now includes a non-secret `accounts` array (name/source/blocked/pinned) for the checked provider; enrichment failures never turn a readable auth state into an error.

### Why

- Account management was confined to the claude-sdk-oauth lane (`assertManagedProvider` hard-rejected every other provider). Generic multi-credential pools need one surface that works for every provider, and scripts consuming `auth check --json` need account visibility without parsing auth.json.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The RPC and app-server consumers dispatch these operations inside core connection handling; an extension cannot replace their imports, and account listing needs the auth storage and pool sidecar wiring that live in core.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `main.ts` auth-check output composition (one enrichment block); `credential-accounts.ts` is fork-new.

## 2026-08-27 - Credential pool: health sidecar, policy schema, env slots, in-lane rotation

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/state-store.ts` (new): file-locked health sidecar at `<agent-dir>/credential-pool-state.json` (mode 0600, `FILE_STORAGE_LOCK_OPTIONS`) holding ONLY health - absolute cooldown deadlines, permanent auth/billing blocks, half-open probe leases, `lastSuccessAt`, and HMAC-derived env-slot revisions. `CredentialSlotRepository.mutateSlotState` is an atomic read-modify-write with a `stateVersion` increment; `acquireHalfOpenLease` transitions an elapsed cooldown to half-open for exactly one probing caller. An unreadable or schema-invalid document resets to fresh state rather than failing auth resolution.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/classify.ts` (new): concrete provider-error taxonomy over `normalizeProviderError` and the existing 429 retry-hint parser. 401/invalid-key and account-scoped 403 block permanently and fail over; bare 403 fails the request; 429 fails over with a per-slot exponential cooldown floored (never overridden) by the server hint and capped at 48h; billing/quota-exhausted disables the account; 5xx/529/overload/network retry the SAME slot without blocking it; overflow, invalid model, 400, 404, malformed stream, and abort fail the request.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/failover.ts` (new): `runCredentialFailover` re-reads slots before each distinct-credential attempt (so a newly added slot participates), runs at most one failover attempt per slot per request, settles a failed stream before starting the next, persists the block BEFORE selecting a replacement, and requires an `isCommittedOutput` predicate whose contract is default-DENY. Committed output bars rotation and the rethrow carries the existing `senpi:no-turn-retry:` marker.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/env-slots.ts` (new): numbered env credential slots for any provider (`<VAR>`, `<VAR>_2` .. `<VAR>_16`), gap-tolerant, over the canonical `getApiKeyEnvVars` mapping.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/rotation-stream.ts` (new): lists a provider's rotation slots with sidecar health overlaid (stored lane when a credential exists, env lane otherwise), selects by sha256 HRW over the request affinity key, and persists blocks per lane. An env slot's persisted health applies only while its HMAC revision still matches the current value.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: `ModelRuntime.stream` engages that rotation only when the provider actually holds more than one slot and nothing pins the request to a single credential (runtime key, explicit per-request `apiKey`, or `credentials.rotation: false`); `prepareRequest` accepts a per-attempt slot override, and `ModelRuntimeAuthOverrides.slotName` plumbs slot-scoped resolution.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config-schema.ts`: per-provider `credentials` policy block (`additionalProperties: false`) with `rotation`/`affinity` toggles, cooldown bounds, and named slot references to env vars or command values; `CREDENTIAL_POLICY_DEFAULTS` re-exports the engine constants so schema and runtime cannot drift.

### Why

- Multi-credential rotation needs durable per-slot health that survives restart with absolute deadlines, a taxonomy that distinguishes credential-scoped from provider-scoped faults (blocking a healthy credential for a provider outage only destroys prompt-cache locality), and a request-level runner that exhausts a lane's slots before the model fallback chain above it is consulted. Health cannot live in `auth.json`: that file is credential material under its own lock, and mixing volatile block state into it would rewrite user credentials on every rate limit.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `ModelRuntime.stream` is the one place where a request's provider auth is resolved and the provider stream is constructed; per-attempt credential selection has to happen inside it. The sidecar likewise needs `getAgentDir()` and the shared file-storage lock policy, neither of which is reachable through the extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `model-runtime.ts` `prepareRequest`/`stream` (upstream-owned request construction; the rotation branch is additive and the single-credential path is unchanged).
- LOW: `model-config-schema.ts` provider block (one optional property); the `credential-pool/` directory is fork-new with no upstream counterpart.

## 2026-08-26 - Capture bash spill-file errors before the first write

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/bash-executor.ts`: attaches an `error` listener as soon as the
  full-output `WriteStream` is created, records the first failure, and rejects the bash execution
  through the terminal `close` boundary even when a late filesystem close failure follows `finish`.
- The close helper waits for `close`, preserves the first storage failure, and removes its error and
  close listeners after settlement so a stream cannot resolve successfully before final storage state
  is known or retain listeners after cleanup.
- Successful command finalization now runs outside the command-execution catch, so an already-set
  abort signal cannot reinterpret a spill close failure as a successful cancelled result.
- Decoder flushing and output preparation now close the spill stream before propagating a callback
  or formatting failure; if cleanup also fails, both errors are preserved in an `AggregateError`.

### Why

- A full `/tmp` or exhausted user quota can make the spill stream emit `ENOSPC` or `EDQUOT` while
  command output is still arriving, or during the final filesystem close after `finish`. The close
  path must therefore wait for `close`, rather than treating `finish` as durable completion; the first
  storage failure is reported instead of returning a successful result with an incomplete path.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The stream is created and written inside the core bash executor before extension result hooks
  receive control.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the temp-file stream creation and close lifecycle in `bash-executor.ts`.

## 2026-08-26 - Continue provider fallback after failed required compaction

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: Cursor token-bearing quota `resource_exhausted`
  and eligible hard-error failures now advance the provider fallback chain when required pre-retry
  compaction is rejected (`retryContinuationBlocked` no longer covers those two classes). Ordinary
  transient retries remain compaction-blocked, and zero-token Cursor `resource_exhausted` keeps its
  compact-before-rotate contract.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the hard-error fallback not-switched path now
  emits `retry_fallback_exhausted` when the configured chain has no usable candidate, mirroring the
  refusal path.

### Why

- Cursor usage-pool exhaustion surfaces as `resource_exhausted` that also demands required
  compaction; the compaction generator runs on the same dead lane and always fails, so the old
  blocking wedged the turn ("Compaction rejected: compaction generator failed" then "Retry failed
  after 1 attempts") and the fallback chain never advanced to the next provider.
- The silent not-switched path gave the TUI no signal about why no fallback hop happened.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `retryContinuationBlocked`, required-compaction admission, and fallback dispatch ordering are
  private `AgentSession` agent_end lifecycle state; extensions observe compaction and fallback
  events only after the core has already made the dispatch decision.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` agent_end retry/compaction dispatch
  block and the `_handleRetryableError` hard-error branch.

## 2026-08-26 - Uncaught-crash writer on the debug-log lane

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/hidden-stdout-log.ts`: factored the existing append (timestamp
  header + `redactSensitiveOutput` + `0o600` debug log) into a private `appendDebugLogEntry` and
  added the sibling `appendUncaughtCrashLog(origin, error)`, which writes the distinct
  `uncaught crash (<origin>)` header plus the error identity and stack. `appendHiddenTuiStdout`
  keeps its exact `hidden stdout while TUI active` header and empty-chunk skip.

### Why

- The interactive crash handler needed a redacted, permission-locked lane into the brand debug log,
  and the hidden-stdout writer already owned that lane. A distinct header keeps crash records
  greppable and prevents them from being read as suppressed TUI stdout.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Fork-only file (absent from the pinned upstream tree); it is the core writer for the brand debug
  log and runs inside the fatal crash path, where no extension code executes.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- NONE: the file does not exist upstream.

## 2026-08-26 - Reject no-progress manual compaction before active abort

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `AgentSession.compact()` now runs the existing
  `prepareCompaction()` check before claiming manual admission or aborting an active agent run.
- A no-progress request still emits balanced manual `compaction_start` / failed `compaction_end`
  events and the existing `session_compact_failed` hook, but it leaves the active continuation alive.

### Why

- A manual compaction request can arrive after automatic tool-result compaction has committed but
  while that same turn's next provider call is streaming. The old order aborted the provider
  continuation first and only then discovered that the pre-abort branch had nothing left to
  summarize, terminally ending otherwise healthy goal work.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Manual compaction admission, active-agent abort ownership, and the pre-abort branch snapshot are
  private `AgentSession` lifecycle state. An extension observes compaction hooks only after the core
  has already admitted the operation.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` around the public `compact()` entry point.

## 2026-08-23 - Provider-declared retry policy profiles (session wiring)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`: forwards `retryPolicy` through provider composition (`extension?.retryPolicy ?? base?.retryPolicy`) so composed providers never silently drop provider-declared retry profiles. `ProviderConfigInput` gained the `retryPolicy` field for config-layer injection.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/settings.ts`: `RetrySettings` gained `providers?: Record<string, RetryPolicyOverride>` for per-provider scheduling-knob overrides.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/profile-override.ts` (new): `validateRetryProviderOverrides` returns warnings (never throws, never mutates) for the `retry.providers.<id>` map, rejecting an entire provider entry atomically when any knob is invalid, and warning once on unknown provider ids.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `resolveRetryProfile(provider)` resolves the effective profile with documented precedence: shipped senpi-default -> provider-declared profile -> user global (no-profile providers only) -> `retry.providers.<id>` -> `retry.enabled` hard gate.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_handleRetryableError` resolves the profile once per failure. `fallback.rateLimited` decides 429 routing ("tiered" keeps today's hint tiers, "after-turn-budget" routes 429s through the ordinary same-model budget). Profile ceiling null bypasses the over-ceiling error path. The kimi routing marks `is429TierRouted` to prevent double-counting with the generic non-429 path. Every same-model budget check (`_willRetryAfterAgentEnd`, `_degradeRateLimitedWithoutFallback`, and all `_handleRetryableError` branches incl. the `auto_retry_start.maxAttempts` field) reads the resolved profile's `turn.maxRetries` — identical to `settings.maxRetries` for providers without a declared profile, and the declared budget (kimi-code's 9) otherwise.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: `streamFn` resolves the profile's `providerRequest` stage for `maxRetries`/`maxRetryDelayMs`; a profile with `providerRequest.enabled === false` sends `maxRetries: 0`.

### Why

- The kimi-coding provider needs kimi-code's own retry policy (10 attempts, uncapped server hints, no immediate 429 fallback) while every other provider keeps senpi's existing behavior byte-identical. The profile resolution happens at the session's failure-handling loop so classification, delay, and fallback routing stay consistent.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The retry decision happens inside the session's own failure-handling loop before any extension hook, and must also cover the transport stage in `sdk.ts`. An extension observing the error after the fact cannot influence the same-model budget, tier routing, or the over-ceiling gate.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` getters region (new `resolveRetryProfile` sibling method).
- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` `_handleRetryableError` profile routing and over-ceiling gate.
- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts` `streamFn` provider-request stage resolution.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts` field forwarding (append-only).
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/settings.ts` + `profile-override.ts` (new module, no upstream owner).

## Core runtime re-diverges from upstream dcd4619 (2026-08-25)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` keeps the fork session runtime (prepared tool
  calls, server-fallback-aborted diagnostics, thinking selection, settlement/idle lifecycle).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts` keeps OAuth auth events, interactions, prompts,
  and login callbacks on the credential store surface.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/footer-data-provider.ts` keeps the polling fallback armed when
  `fs.watch` creation fails (descriptor limits, unsupported filesystems).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts` keeps `app.history.search` (ctrl+r) and
  `app.models.toggleFavorite` (ctrl+f) with their record guards.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts` keeps the extracted `model-config-schema.ts`
  validation module and `samplingParams` passthrough.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts` keeps scoped-model resolution, service tiers,
  initial-model provenance, and the `AvailableModelsSource` snapshot interface.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts` keeps wire identity, payload request metadata,
  and remote-catalog provider routing.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/pi-manifest.ts`
  keep the `hooks` resource type and branded `envValue("OFFLINE")` reads.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts` keeps the extracted api-key/header auth
  composition modules and tool-call middleware wrapping.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts` keeps bundled shim banners, builtin extension
  factories, and the cwd-scoped extension cache.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts` keeps auth storage, the cursor exec bridge, transport
  image budgets, model registry wiring, and initial-model provenance.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` keeps the session-discovery/resident-store
  split and the inlined UUIDv7 (upstream depends on the `uuid` package).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` keeps retry/hint policy settings, lockfile
  policy, nearest-parent config, and atomic settings writes.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts` keeps `/favorite-models` and the `/exit` alias.

### Why

These are fork-owned product surfaces (senpi branding, provider wire behavior, fork runtime features) that upstream does not carry; the sync must re-assert them on top of upstream's tree.

### Why this lives in the fork

The divergence lives in core wiring, package identity, or build plumbing that executes before any extension loads, so no extension hook can express it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`,
  and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` are the highest-churn files in every sync;
  expect import-block and constructor-wiring conflicts there first.

## 2026-08-23 - Slot-preserving credential writes for multi-account pools

### What changed

- `packages/ai/src/auth/pool/slots.ts` (new, exported as `@earendil-works/pi-ai/auth/pool/slots`): pure slot algebra over a provider credential - `listSlots`, `findSlot`, `upsertSlot`, `removeSlot`, `pinSlot`, `assertValidSlotName`. A stored credential with no `accounts` array is read as a one-slot pool named `default` derived from its flat fields, without writing anything back. `upsertSlot` replaces or appends one slot and leaves every sibling, the pin, and the flat top-level credential untouched. `removeSlot` drops the provider entry once its last slot is gone and clears a pin naming the removed slot.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`: added `listSlots`, `setSlot`, and `removeSlot` delegating to that module; `set()` now appends to a pool (generated `login-N` slot, siblings preserved) instead of replacing the provider entry, so the RPC `login_api_key` path no longer destroys sibling slots; flat providers keep today's whole-write shape (imported via the new vitest source alias for `@earendil-works/pi-ai/auth/*` in `vitest.base.ts`). Each write runs inside the existing `storage.withLock` read-modify-write and rebuilds the provider entry from the locked content, so unrelated providers and sibling slots survive.

### Why

- `set()` replaces a whole provider entry and `remove()` deletes it, so any provider holding more than one credential lost every sibling the moment one slot was written. Multi-account support needs a write path that preserves siblings before any pooled data can exist. The flat top-level credential is deliberately retained on a pooled entry so a senpi build that predates pools still authenticates from it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `AuthStorage` is the app-owned `CredentialStore` implementation and the only holder of the `auth.json` lock; slot-preserving semantics must live inside that locked read-modify-write, which no extension can enter.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the new methods sit immediately after `remove()` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`; `credential-slots.ts` is a new file with no upstream counterpart.

## 2026-08-25 - Fall back on Cursor usage-pool exhaustion

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: admits token-bearing Cursor `resource_exhausted` failures as a dedicated fallback class, retires failed assistants before fallback, and annotates terminal no-fallback errors with the likely usage-pool cause.

### Why

- Cursor quota exhaustion was misclassified as overflow and entered compaction loops; mid-turn tool calls also require explicit retry admission outside the generic hard-error gate.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Retry admission, assistant retirement, and provider fallback are private AgentSession lifecycle boundaries.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: Cursor retry admission and fallback dispatch in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`.

## 2026-08-25 - Harden watchdog abort accounting and retry jitter

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: carries watchdog provenance and applies injected jitter while preserving provider hints and 429 floors.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts`: includes provider abort ownership in `agent_end`.

### Why

- Watchdog aborts must remain retryable and consume the configured budget; delay jitter must not alter provider hints or the 429 exponential floor.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session retry admission and lifecycle event typing are core boundaries with no extension seam.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` retry scheduling and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts` event contract.
## 2026-08-24 - expose abort provenance to interactive rendering

### What changed

- `agent-abort-provenance.ts` exposes the current explicit abort owner across the active and settlement boundaries.
- `agent-session.ts` exposes that owner through the read-only `currentAbortSource` getter for the interactive renderer.

### Why

- An assistant `stopReason: "aborted"` does not prove that the user cancelled. Provider retry watchdogs can produce the same terminal shape without explicit ownership, while user and system aborts are recorded by `AgentAbortProvenance`.
- The renderer needs the existing provenance at message finalization so it can persist an accurate user, system, or provider label that remains correct when the transcript is replayed.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Abort ownership is private AgentSession lifecycle state and the assistant message is finalized before the extension-visible `agent_end` event.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `agent-abort-provenance.ts` source getter and the `AgentSession` read-only state getters.

## 2026-08-22 - Retarget OpenAI automatic defaults to GPT-5.6 Sol

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: retargeted the `openai` and `openai-codex` provider defaults from `gpt-5.5` to `gpt-5.6-sol` while retaining GPT-5.5 in catalogs and explicit settings resolution.

### Why

- Automatic startup recommendation should follow the current recommended GPT-5.6 Sol model; saved GPT-5.5 selections remain explicitly selectable.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `defaultModelPerProvider` is consumed by core initial-model resolution before extension recommendations are applied.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the OpenAI provider entries in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`.

## 2026-08-22 - emit agent_idle after settlement-deferred turns resolve

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-settled-delivery.ts`: added `DeferredTurnClaim` / `DeferredTurnDisposition` (`started` / `delegated` / `finished-without-start`) and `deferTriggerTurn`, so a settlement-deferred turn request declares whether it actually started a run. Claims resolve at the `_promptAgent` admission boundary.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: after the deferred-action loop in `_emitAgentSettled`, an out-of-band check waits for all deferred turn dispositions, skips emission when any turn `started`, waits for delegated session work to drain, verifies the settlement epoch is still current, and emits `{ type: "agent_idle" }` only when no agent run or session work is active. Both settlement-deferred turn APIs register a claim: `sendMessage(..., { triggerTurn: true })` via `deferTriggerTurn`, and `sendUserMessage` (which always triggers a turn) via a claim resolved from its prompt disposition; its content normalization is wrapped so a throwing iterator/getter resolves the claim instead of hanging the idle wait. `agent_settled` ordering is unchanged for existing subscribers.

### Why

- The TUI cleared its working-status dock on the public `agent_settled`, but settlement-deferred continuations (TTSR, loop-guard, goal recovery) start a turn *after* that event, so the dock was removed and immediately remounted - the same vertical bounce the jitter fix exists to eliminate. `_isAgentRunActive` alone cannot decide this at the deferred-action loop because a deferred `sendCustomMessage`/`sendUserMessage` can be suspended at compaction/provider admission before reaching `_promptAgent`, and a throwing content normalization could leave the claim unresolved forever. `agent_idle` is the single race-free boundary for final cleanup.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Settlement-deferred turn admission, the settlement epoch, and the deferred-turn claim lifecycle are private `AgentSession` / `AgentSettledDelivery` state.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` `_emitAgentSettled`, `_promptAgent`, `sendCustomMessage`, `sendUserMessage`, and the `AgentEvent` union.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-settled-delivery.ts`.

## 2026-08-21 - Auth-storage lock retry sleeps instead of spinning

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`: `FileAuthStorageBackend.acquireLockSyncWithRetry` replaces the `while (Date.now() - start < delayMs) {}` busy-wait with `Atomics.wait` on a `SharedArrayBuffer`. The wait stays synchronous (callers and the 20ms/10-attempt policy unchanged) but the thread actually sleeps.

### Why

- This is the same defect PR #1056 removed from `settings-manager.ts`, but `auth-storage.ts` was left out of both #1056 and #1057. The sync `withLock` paths (`reload()`, `set()`, `remove()`) reach it, so under multi-session OAuth-refresh contention (auth.json rewritten by other sessions, forcing `reload()` through a contended lock) a synchronous auth write could spin up to 10×20ms of pure CPU on the main thread.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `FileAuthStorageBackend` is the core credential persistence path with no extension seam.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `auth-storage.ts` around `acquireLockSyncWithRetry` (line ~95).


## 2026-08-21 - Settings reads are lock-free; writes publish atomically via temp+rename

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `FileSettingsStorage.withLock` no longer acquires the settings lock for read-only callbacks. The initial read happens without the lock; only a callback that returns content acquires the lock, re-reads under it, re-runs the callback when a concurrent winner changed the file, and publishes by writing a same-directory `*.tmp` file then `renameSync`-ing it over the settings path. `recordSelfWrite` fires before the rename so the config-reload watcher's self-write suppression still sees the hash first. A failed publish removes the temp file and rethrows.

### Why

- Follow-up to the settings-lock CPU-spin fix (#1056). Locked reads were the remaining lock-pressure source: every `SettingsManager` load acquired the lock even when nothing was written, so cache misses and multi-session startups still convoyed on `settings.json.lock`. Atomic rename publish makes torn reads impossible, which is the precondition for dropping the read lock entirely.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `FileSettingsStorage` is the core settings persistence path with no extension seam.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `settings-manager.ts` around `withLock` (line ~555) and the `fs` import list (line ~5).


## 2026-08-21 - Settings-lock retry sleeps instead of spinning; retry-fallback canonicalization memoized

### What changed

- `settings-manager.ts`: `acquireLockSyncWithRetry` replaces the `while (Date.now() - start < delayMs)` busy-wait with `Atomics.wait` on a `SharedArrayBuffer`. The wait stays synchronous (callers and the 20ms/10-attempt policy unchanged) but the thread actually sleeps, so contended retries no longer burn a CPU core per waiter.
- `retry-fallback/controller.ts`: `RetryFallbackController` memoizes `canonicalizeFallbackChains` by the serialized chains content. `canTryFallback`/`nextCandidate`/`hasConfiguredChain` reuse the canonical result for an unchanged config; a chains edit invalidates immediately; `clear()` drops the memo.

### Why

- Provider-error handling calls `canTryFallback` 4-6 times per error, each re-canonicalizing chains whose oauth-lane eligibility probes create fresh `SettingsManager` instances and locked disk reads. With ~12 sessions sharing one settings.json the lock convoy made every waiter busy-spin on the main thread, starving the TUI render loop and freezing the screen at ~100% CPU under 429/5xx storms. V8 profile of a frozen omo process showed 65% in `acquireLockSyncWithRetry` and 18% in `parseSettingsJson`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The settings file lock and the retry-fallback controller are core storage and session-admission paths with no extension seam.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `settings-manager.ts` around `acquireLockSyncWithRetry` (line ~527). `retry-fallback/controller.ts` around `nextCandidate`/`hasConfiguredChain` and the new `canonicalChains` private method.


## 2026-08-20 - Resume picker caches exact streaming summaries

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: session listing now delegates picker-row discovery instead of parsing every JSONL record itself.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-summary.ts`: streams each cold JSONL file once and preserves the exact prior row contract: first user text, latest name, maximum activity timestamp, parsed message count, parent/cwd, and full search text.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-summary-cache.ts`: reuses summaries while canonical path, size, and mtime match.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-summary-lru.ts`: caps retained summaries at 4,096 entries and 64 MiB of UTF-8 transcript text, evicting least-recently-used rows and refusing oversized entries without changing their returned result.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-discovery.ts`: builds and sorts picker rows from the exact cached summaries with the existing bounded-concurrency loader.

### Why

- `/resume` previously reparsed every message in every unchanged session each time the selector opened. The cost scaled with aggregate session bytes and made repeated selector use visibly slower as histories grew.
- Cold discovery still performs one exact streaming fold so picker metadata and full-text search do not regress. Reopening `/resume` validates one stat per file and reuses unchanged summaries; byte and entry budgets bound process-lifetime retention.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session directory enumeration and `SessionInfo` construction happen inside the core `SessionManager.list()` / `listAll()` path before extensions receive a session or selector hook.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` imports and the `list()` / `listAll()` delegation around session discovery.
- LOW: the new `session-discovery.ts`, `session-summary*.ts`, and `session-record.ts` modules are fork-owned extraction points.

## 2026-08-20 - Session title uses session-model auth

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_generateSessionTitle` now calls `_getSummarizationRequestAuth(model)` instead of `_getCompactionRequestAuth(model)`.

### Why

- Compaction auth can be remapped to another provider (see #974). Title generation still streams with the session model, so a remapped key produces `session_title_generation` `unauthenticated` on Cursor while the main turn works.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Title generation is private session lifecycle. There is no extension hook for the title complete auth.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` `_generateSessionTitle`.

## 2026-08-20 - Cursor 0-token RE stays on the same model and shrinks

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: 0-token Cursor `resource_exhausted` retries with `sameModelRemint` instead of 429/k3 fallback; overflow compact uses Cursor keep-recent-0 settings; too-small compact truncates to the last user turn.

### Why

- `resource.?exhausted` was classified as a 429 transient fallback, and overflow compact that saved <1% still retried the same Cursor payload.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Retry fallback and pre-prompt compaction are core AgentSession admission paths.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` `_handleRetryableError`, `_executeCompaction`, `_isHardErrorFallbackEligible`.

## 2026-08-20 - streamRetryTimeoutMs docstring aligned with the reconciled watchdog (issue #723 lane)

### What changed

- `core/retry-fallback/settings.ts`: the `streamRetryTimeoutMs` interface comment now states the actual
  post-2026-08-18 semantics — it caps the retry-CONTINUATION watchdog, reconciled to
  `max(cap, streamStartTimeoutMs)` — instead of the stale "first-request liveness cap after a provider
  timeout" wording. Comment-only; no behavior change.

### Why

- Issue #723 diagnosis (M3) read that comment and concluded the setting clamps the stream-start guard
  itself. It does not: since the 2026-08-18 reconciliation the retry request keeps its full granted
  guard and only the continuation watchdog takes this cap. A wrong comment on the exact knob a
  retry-storm investigation reaches first sends the next diagnosis down the same dead end.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The setting is a core `ProviderRetrySettings` field consumed by `core/provider-timeout-retry.ts`; the
  doc contract lives with the interface.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `core/retry-fallback/settings.ts` `ProviderRetrySettings` field list only (comment line).
## 2026-08-20 - Cursor exec emits tool_result after native write/edit

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-exec-bridge.ts`: `executeTool` now calls `emitToolResult` after `tool_execution_end`, passing cleaned args and the real result so plan-touch listeners see native exec writes.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-exec-bridge-session.ts`: wires the bridge's optional `emitToolResult` to `emitExecBridgeToolResult` on the session.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: adds `emitExecBridgeToolResult`, which runs `_emitAfterToolCallHooks` so the same `tool_result` hook path as the local tool loop fires after Cursor exec.

### Why

- Cursor exec runs `write`/`edit` via `tool.execute` and previously only emitted `tool_execution_end`. Plan-touch trackers listen to `tool_result`, so momus stayed gated after a real `.omo/plans/*.md` write (#989).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The exec-bridge factory is inside `packages/coding-agent` before any omo hook sees the stream; an extension cannot inject `tool_result` into a path that never emitted it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-exec-bridge.ts` `executeTool` (ownership recheck after preflight plus `emitToolResult`).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-exec-bridge-session.ts` session wiring.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` `emitExecBridgeToolResult`.
## 2026-08-20 - Append-only goal continuations and exponentially floored 429 waits

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/messages.ts`: removed `keepLatestGoalContinuationMessage()`.
  `filterContextExcludedMessages()` is now an explicit identity pass and `convertToLlm()` maps the full
  input array, so every accepted `goal-continuation` custom message stays in provider-visible chronological
  history. `GOAL_CONTINUATION_MESSAGE_TYPE` and `isContextExcludedCustomMessage() === false` are unchanged;
  no dedupe by content, goal id, wake source, or streak was added. Session JSONL format and
  `queueHiddenGoalPrompt()` are untouched.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/hint-policy.ts`: `nextInTurnDelayMs()` computes
  `exponentialFloorMs = baseDelayMs * 2 ** (attempt - 1)` and applies it to all three same-model branches
  (half-used deadline remainder, first hinted idle probe, and the done/hint-override path). The floored
  delay — not the raw hint — feeds `cumulativeHintedWaitMs`, so cap demotion accounts for time actually
  slept. `degradeWithoutFallback()` tier 2 raises its cap-clamped wait to the same floor. The probe state
  machine, tier boundaries, budgets, and the tier-3 terminal verdict are unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: comments only near 429 detection and retry scheduling,
  recording that the exponential floor lives in the pure policy and must not be recomputed at the call site.
  No control-flow change.

### Why

- Anthropic-style prompt caching keys on an exact message-array prefix. Dropping a previously sent
  continuation made request N stop being a prefix of request N+1, so every token ahead of the deletion point
  missed cache and was re-read at full price. In team mode, where continuations arrive every turn, that
  produced sustained cache-miss traffic and 429 storms (#1005). Keeping continuations append-only is the
  smallest change that restores prefix immutability; context growth is a deliberate trade bounded by normal
  compaction.
- The 429 handler previously let a provider hint fully replace the exponential schedule. A provider that
  repeats a 5 ms `retry-after` on every rate-limit pinned the same-model retry cadence at 5 ms, so the
  session hammered a model that was already refusing it. Flooring each wait guarantees monotonic pressure
  relief while still honouring hints longer than the floor.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `filterContextExcludedMessages()` / `convertToLlm()` run inside the core transport and compaction paths
  (`agent-session.ts`, `compaction/compaction.ts`); an extension's `transformContext` hook fires before this
  core-owned filter, so it cannot prevent a core deletion of already-sent turns.
- The 429 wait is computed by the pure retry policy inside the session's own retry loop. Extensions observe
  `auto_retry_start` after the delay has been decided and cannot rewrite `delayMs` or the probe state.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `messages.ts` top-of-file exclusion helpers and the `convertToLlm()` entry line — any concurrent
  change that reintroduces context filtering there will collide.
- MEDIUM: `retry-fallback/hint-policy.ts` `nextInTurnDelayMs()` branch bodies and the
  `degradeWithoutFallback()` tier-2 return.
- LOW: `agent-session.ts` 429 detection and retry-delay comments (comment-only lines).
- LOW: `test/suite/goal-continuation-context-exclusion.test.ts`,
  `test/suite/retry-fallback-hint-policy.test.ts`, and
  `test/suite/regressions/issue-447-goal-continuation.test.ts`, whose assertions moved from
  keep-latest-only to append-only.

## 2026-08-20 - Skip Cursor compaction while a native Run is live

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `compactBeforeNextAdmission` no-ops for `cursor` / `cursor-cli-oauth` so mid-turn tool-loop admission does not compact while a native Cursor Run is live.

### Why

- Cursor rebuilds full conversation state each hop. Mid-turn compact desyncs `conversationId` and the next hop returns 0-token `resource_exhausted` (session 01a01879, issue #984).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Tool-loop admission and pre-turn compaction live in `AgentSession.prepareNextTurnWithContext`; an extension cannot skip that core call.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` `compactBeforeNextAdmission`

## 2026-08-20 - Ignore implausible Cursor billed usage in compaction threshold

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_resolveThresholdContextTokens` now delegates to `resolveThresholdContextTokens` so a billed usage figure more than 8× a ≥50k local estimate is ignored for the compaction threshold.

### Why

- Complements the billed-cacheRead guard in cursor-agent. When no checkpoint arrived, a 4M `cacheRead` still must not beat a 149k transcript estimate.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Threshold resolution runs inside `AgentSession` before any session hook sees the assistant message.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` `_resolveThresholdContextTokens`

## Shared notice styling for built-in cards (2026-08-20)

### What changed

- The prompt URL widget and the multi-line pi-rules banner now render through `buildNoticeBox`, retaining their existing titles, paths, diagnostics, and URL details while using the shared notice background and bold tone title.
- The compact pi-rules footer remains a one-line status surface and is unchanged.

### Why

- These built-in multi-line cards were visually divergent from every transcript notice renderer and did not carry the `customMessageBg` notice background.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The built-in widget and rules banner own their component rendering before another extension can restyle the returned component.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `extensions/builtin/prompt-url-widget.ts` widget construction and `extensions/builtin/rules/ui/rules-banner.ts` multi-line rendering.

## Cursor exec emits tool_result after native write/edit (2026-08-19)

`executeTool` now calls `emitToolResult` after `tool_execution_end`. Cursor exec runs `write`/`edit` without the local tool loop, so momus `hasPlanArtifact()` never saw `.omo/plans/*.md` touches.

Conflict zone: `cursor-exec-bridge.ts` `executeTool`, `cursor-exec-bridge-session.ts`, `agent-session.ts` `emitExecBridgeToolResult`.

## Provider-declared fallback-expansion eligibility gate (2026-08-19)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`: `ProviderConfigInput` gained optional
  `fallbackEligible?(): boolean`, the extension-owned deterministic usability gate for implicit
  bare-family fallback expansion.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: new `isFallbackEligible(providerId)` consults the
  registered hook; hookless providers and throwing hooks stay eligible so expansion never shrinks on
  uncertainty.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`: new `isFallbackEligible(model)` forwards the
  per-provider verdict to `core/retry-fallback/` chain canonicalization.

### Why

- Bare expansion ranked OAuth-credential providers first without asking whether the lane could execute;
  a credentialed cursor-cli-oauth lane with an unacknowledged `--force` gate ranked tier 0, entered the
  shipped `claude-opus-5:xhigh` default chain, and hard-errored on every fallback hop (see
  `core/extensions/changes.md` 2026-08-19).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Chain canonicalization runs inside `core/retry-fallback/` against the model registry; no extension
  hook observes it. The eligibility signal itself stays extension-owned via the registration field.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `provider-composer.ts` end of `ProviderConfigInput`; `model-runtime.ts` near `hasConfiguredAuth`;
  `model-registry.ts` near `isUsingOAuth`.

## 2026-09-04 - Make reftable polling content-aware

### What changed

- `footer-data-provider.ts` now retains the last `tables.list` contents and compares content on each polling callback in addition to filesystem metadata.

### Why

- Filesystem timestamp precision can make a changed reftable table list look unchanged when its size and timestamps are identical, leaving the footer branch stale.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Reftable detection is core footer session plumbing and is not observable or replaceable by an extension.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `footer-data-provider.ts` reftable polling callback.

## 2026-08-19 upstream sync integration repair (footer-data-provider watcher fallback)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/footer-data-provider.ts`: `setupGitWatcher` no longer returns early when a
  watcher fails to register. The `tables.list` polling fallback is armed whenever the file exists, and its path is
  recorded after the watcher attempt because a failed registration synchronously clears watcher state.

### Why

- Carried forward from `origin/main` during the upstream sync merge. Tracker files resolve to `ours` on merges,
  which would otherwise drop this entry and leave the path uncovered for the next upstream audit.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Footer git-state polling is core session plumbing owned by the CLI runtime; an extension cannot re-arm the
  internal watcher fallback or reach the reftable polling path.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `footer-data-provider.ts` `setupGitWatcher` reftable block.

## 2026-08-19 - Core session, settings, packaging, and catalog divergence after the upstream 59a71b23 pin

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the fork session keeps its own compaction stack over
  upstream's newly centralized one — `CompactionLifecycleCoordinator`, typed `CompactionReason`
  (`manual`/`threshold`/`overflow`/`pre_prompt`/`branch`/`extension`) and `CompactionRejectionCause` with
  human-readable rejection text, warm-anchor admission (`isWarmSummaryAnchorValid`), request ids on
  `compaction_start`/`compaction_progress`/`compaction_end`, and real `CacheFriendlySummaryOptions`
  (`sourceContext`/`turnPrefixSourceContext`) where upstream still passes `undefined // cacheFriendly`. It also
  keeps the `-fast` service-tier state machine (`serviceTier`, `isFastModeActive()`, `service_tier_changed`
  events, per-model tier memory) and the `senpi:`-prefixed hook/diagnostic custom-message types.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: retains the fork settings schema and loaders upstream has
  no counterpart for — JSONC parsing that ignores comment-like text inside strings, brand-aware `envValue()` and
  `findNearestParentConfigDir()` resolution, lockfile policy, retry/fallback settings
  (`resolveRetryFallbackSettings`, hint policy, abort server-side fallback), speculative/idle compaction and
  restoration knobs, prompt-cache and look-at settings, per-model thinking/service-tier memory, smooth-streaming
  and tips settings, `hooks` sources, and builtin-extension enable/disable lists.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts`: keeps `hooks` as a fifth resource type (`.json` pattern,
  user and project dirs, override lists, accumulator and resolved-path maps), the legacy `.pi` project base dir
  scan when it differs from the branded one, and branded offline detection via `envValue("OFFLINE")`. Upstream's
  `semver.gt` version comparison arrived through the merge and is retained unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-provider.ts`: keeps `FORK_ONLY_BUILTIN_PROVIDERS`
  (`alibaba-token-plan`, `opengateway`) with `remoteCatalogServesProvider()` so the pi.dev overlay is skipped for
  providers upstream's catalog cannot serve, and `mergeInputModalities()` so an overlay entry never drops an input
  modality the built-in model already declares.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts`: keeps the fork's skill-listing guidance (load a skill whenever its
  description even loosely matches, because loading an irrelevant skill is cheap and missing a relevant one is
  not) and the branded `~/.senpi/agent` default in `LoadSkillsOptions.agentDir`. Upstream's nested markdown skill
  discovery from this sync is retained as-is.

### Why

- These files carry fork-only product behavior — compaction affinity/lifecycle ownership, `-fast` priority tiers,
  fork-only providers and catalog overlays, hooks packaging, legacy `.pi` layout support, and senpi branding —
  that the advanced pin does not contain, so they legitimately remain divergent after the merge instead of being
  reset to upstream's tree.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Compaction admission, settings resolution, resource discovery, and the model-catalog overlay all execute before
  or beneath the extension runner: extensions are loaded from the settings and resources these modules resolve,
  and the compaction hooks they can observe are emitted by this same session code.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts` compaction execution/admission block and the summarization request wiring.
- MEDIUM: `settings-manager.ts` settings interfaces and load/merge paths; `package-manager.ts` per-resource
  literal lists (`FILE_PATTERNS`, dirs, overrides, accumulator) where each new resource type must gain `hooks`.
- LOW: `remote-catalog-provider.ts` around `mergeModels()`; `skills.ts` prompt guidance line and the `agentDir`
  doc comment.

## 2026-08-18 - Resume active goals stuck after suppressed continuation-flood loads

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `sendCustomMessage` with `triggerTurn` no longer waits on
  `_sessionWorkBarrier` while the session-start binding itself holds it (`_extensionBindingPromptReadiness`
  active). A trigger-turn message queued from the `session_start` emission — a goal continuation queued on
  resume — previously waited on the very work that was delivering it, so the resumed session rendered the TUI
  but never started a turn.
- `core/extensions/builtin/goal/index.ts` + `direct-input-lifecycle.ts`: a suppressed flooded load now arms a
  one-shot latch; the next accepted user message (the "Send a message to resume" the notice promises) queues
  the goal continuation immediately instead of only resetting the continuation streak.
- Coverage: `test/suite/goal-extension.test.ts` (queues a continuation when the user sends a message after a
  suppressed flooded load) and `test/suite/agent-session-queue.test.ts` (triggerTurn send does not wait on the
  binding-phase barrier; fails pre-fix via a deadlock race).

### Why

- A resumed session whose branch ends in >= `GOAL_CONTINUATION_CAP` trailing continuations suppresses
  auto-continuation by design, but the documented resume path was a dead end: the user message reset the
  streak without queueing a continuation, and even once queued the continuation deadlocked on the
  binding-held barrier. Reproduced against a clone of the stuck session; post-fix the continuation is
  delivered and the agent resumes.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The barrier admission condition lives in `AgentSession.sendCustomMessage`, and the resume latch lives in the
  builtin goal extension's own load/disposition path; both are core session-lifecycle surfaces.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `core/agent-session.ts` `sendCustomMessage` wait condition, and the goal extension `session_start`
  suppressed-load branch in `core/extensions/builtin/goal/index.ts`.


## 2026-08-25 - Harden provider retry watchdog ownership and backoff

### What changed

- `core/provider-timeout-retry.ts`: gives the retry-continuation watchdog a proportional 10% grace beyond the granted stream-start guard, preserving `0`/`undefined` opt-out behavior.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: mark watchdog aborts as provider-owned and retain the real watchdog cause for retry classification and terminal reporting; retry delays use injected +/-10% jitter.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-abort-provenance.ts`: carries provider abort ownership through `agent_end`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts`: adds provider abort ownership to the public `agent_end` event type.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: apply injected retry jitter while preserving provider hints and 429 exponential floors.
- `modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts` and `modes/interactive/aborted-error-label.ts`: render labels without mutating persisted messages.
- `modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts` and `modes/interactive/aborted-error-label.ts`: render abort labels from a copied message rather than mutating session state.

### Why

- The watchdog starts before the retried request starts its stream-start timer, so equal deadlines deterministically laundered a retryable stall into an unclassifiable abort and discarded remaining retry budget.
- Codex-style jitter prevents synchronized retry storms while provider Retry-After hints remain lower bounds.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Retry watchdog ownership, Agent abort propagation, session retry accounting, and message finalization are core lifecycle boundaries with no extension seam.

### Policy note

- Non-429 provider retry hints remain authoritative. Jitter applies only when no provider hint is present; 429-tier scheduling remains deterministic so its exponential floor remains a true floor.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `core/provider-timeout-retry.ts`, `core/agent-session.ts`, and `packages/agent/src/{agent.ts,agent-loop.ts}`.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts`, and interactive aborted-label rendering.

## 2026-08-18 - Retry continuation watchdog reconciled with the guards it grants

### What changed

- `core/provider-timeout-retry.ts`: `createProviderTimeoutRetryPlan` now reconciles the retry-continuation
  liveness cap against the stream-start guard the same retry is handed:
  `watchdogTimeoutMs = max(streamRetryTimeoutMs, streamStartTimeoutMs)`. An explicitly disabled cap
  (`undefined`) stays disabled, and a cap that already outlasts the granted guard is returned unchanged.
- Coverage: `test/provider-timeout-retry-continuation.test.ts` (new; first direct coverage of
  `runBoundedRetryContinuation`), extended `test/provider-timeout-retry.test.ts`, and updated
  `test/suite/regressions/provider-idle-recovery.test.ts`.

### Why

- This completes the 2026-08-13 fix below. That change stopped clamping the retry *request* guards to
  `retry.provider.streamRetryTimeoutMs`, but left the same 30s cap bounding the retry *continuation*, which
  reproduced the identical defect one layer up: `runBoundedRetryContinuation` aborted the attempt at 30s while
  the request still had 60s of its configured 90s stream-start budget left.
- No attempt could therefore finish, so the bounded `retry.maxRetries` budget (default 3) collapsed into the
  single user-visible `Provider stream start timed out after 90000ms (raise streamStartTimeoutMs — retry.provider.streamStartTimeoutMs in senpi settings; 0 disables)` / `Aborted after 1 retry attempt`
  outcome. A slow-but-alive provider was again judged dead on a deadline it was never given.
- Raising the watchdog to the granted guard preserves the wedge protection it was added for: the provider
  guards still fail a dead upstream, and the watchdog still cancels a retry that outlives every guard it was
  granted.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The retry continuation bound and its abort ownership are core session-lifecycle surfaces with no extension
  hook.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `core/provider-timeout-retry.ts` plan construction, and the retry-bound constants in
  `test/suite/regressions/provider-idle-recovery.test.ts`.


## Queue typed input admitted during auto-compaction (2026-08-18)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `prompt()` gained a
  `canQueueDuringAutoCompaction` eligibility flag for a queueable submission
  (`streamingBehavior` set) that arrives while auto-compaction owns the session
  and no run is streaming. The flag suppresses the settled-session-work wait and
  routes the message through `_queueSteer`/`_queueFollowUp` beside the existing
  queue branches, after extension input handling and template expansion.

### Why

- `isCompacting` is true for the auto, manual, and branch-summary controllers,
  but the admission guard rejects only on `_compactionAbortController`, so
  auto-compaction never rejected typed input. That input then matched no queue
  branch — `canQueueWhileStreaming` requires `!isCompacting` — and fell through
  neither queued nor started, so a message typed while the TUI showed
  "Compacting context..." was accepted and silently dropped.
- Gating on the auto controller alone keeps the manual `/compact` fail-closed
  admission path and the post-compaction recovery continuation unchanged; a
  broader `isCompacting` relaxation regressed both.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Prompt admission and queue ownership run inside the session before any
  extension input hook observes the submission, so an extension cannot recover
  input the engine has already dropped.

### Expected merge-conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the `prompt()` queue
  eligibility constants and the queue branches preceding the settled-work wait.

## Cursor bridge dispatches bind to the run that owns the stream (2026-08-18)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-exec-bridge-session.ts`: the session
  adapter accepts the signal of the run that owns the exec stream and resolves
  `getAbortSignal` from it, returning `undefined` once that run is no longer
  the agent's live run. Adapters created without a captured owner fail closed
  instead of adopting whichever run is currently live.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-exec-bridge.ts`: dispatch rechecks the
  captured signal after awaited preflight work and before `tool.execute()`, so
  a run that ends during approval cannot start a side effect afterward.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: supplies the bridge as a per-run
  factory so every Cursor stream gets handlers bound to its own run.

### Why

- The bridge is built once per session, but each exec stream belongs to exactly
  one run. Resolving ownership from the agent's live signal let a straggler
  frame from a stream whose run had already ended adopt the replacement run's
  signal, clear the ownership guard in `Agent.emitExternalEvent`, and execute a
  dead run's tool inside the new run while emitting its lifecycle events into
  the new run's transcript.
- This is the shape the crashed 2026-08-18 session hit: a provider rate-limit
  error restarted the run on a fallback lane while the previous stream still
  held buffered exec frames.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Run ownership of provider-driven exec frames is an engine contract between
  the agent loop and the Cursor stream; no extension hook sits between the
  straggler frame and the bridge dispatch.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `cursor-exec-bridge-session.ts` signature and `getAbortSignal` resolution,
  `sdk.ts` `cursorExecHandlers` wiring.
## 2026-08-18 - Cursor reasoning levels: session provenance and legacy id resolution

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`, `agent-session-services.ts`, `session-manager.ts`:
  record, persist, and restore provenance-bearing thinking selections (explicit user actions, CLI `:suffix`,
  favorites, legacy variant ids); defaulted levels stay selection-free and next-turn refresh returns the
  selection so mid-run switches propagate.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: resolve allowlisted legacy Cursor variant ids to their
  grouped identity plus selection ahead of generic partial matching, and project wildcard/enabled/favorite
  patterns across the alias union without cross-provider projection.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`: carry the startup selection into agent state.

### Why

- The Cursor catalog now publishes grouped identities, so sessions, favorites, and enabled-model patterns that
  referenced the old expanded variant ids must keep resolving, with the level they encoded preserved.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session state, persistence entries, startup model resolution, and favorite/enabled pattern expansion are
  core surfaces with no extension hook.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `model-resolver.ts` pattern matching and partial-match ordering, `agent-session.ts` thinking-level setters,
  `session-manager.ts` entry schema.

## Cursor bridge lifecycle events retain run ownership (2026-08-18)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-exec-bridge.ts`: bridge executions
  require and capture the active run signal before emitting
  `tool_execution_start`, pass that same signal through every matching
  `tool_execution_end` path, and await lifecycle delivery.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-exec-bridge-session.ts`: the session
  adapter forwards that captured signal to agent-core and returns its promise
  to the bridge.

### Why

- An aborted bridge tool can settle after a replacement run has started. The
  signal lets agent-core discard the stale lifecycle event instead of
  delivering it to the replacement run.
- A bridge dispatch with no active run is refused before tool execution, and
  active-run listener failures stay attached to the dispatch instead of
  becoming detached unhandled rejections.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The run signal is owned by the engine bridge before extension preflight and
  tool execution, so an extension cannot reliably reconstruct the originating
  run after the asynchronous tool settles.

### Expected merge-conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-exec-bridge.ts`: lifecycle emission
  around preflight and tool execution.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/cursor-exec-bridge-session.ts`: the
  agent-core event forwarding adapter.

## Single availability scan across provider re-register (2026-08-18)

### What changed

- `model-runtime.ts`: `registerProvider` / `registerNativeProvider` skip `refreshAfterRegistration` when the provider is already registered and the availability snapshot is fresh. An optional `{ refresh: false }` defers the scan so a caller can do one refresh after a batch.
- `agent-session-services.ts`: the create-time pending-registration drain uses `{ refresh: false }`, then keeps the existing single `refresh({ allowNetwork: false })`.
- `test/model-runtime-registration-refresh.test.ts`: re-registering a native provider already in a fresh snapshot does not run another catalog refresh.

### Why

- Session reload re-binds the same extension provider and started a second full availability scan. Create-time drain also fire-and-forgot a registration refresh that could `credentials.list()` after create returned. `reload-efficiency` expected one `list()` per reload and failed deterministically on current main, which blocked `release:local` `npm test`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Availability refresh and provider registration are core `ModelRuntime` contracts. Extensions cannot coalesce those scans.

### Expected merge-conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `registerProvider` / `registerNativeProvider` in `model-runtime.ts` and the drain loop in `agent-session-services.ts`.

## Cerebras default retarget after live catalog drift (2026-08-18)

### What changed

- `model-resolver.ts`: `defaultModelPerProvider.cerebras` is now `gpt-oss-120b` instead of `zai-glm-4.7`.
- `test/model-resolver.test.ts`: the pinned Cerebras default expectation matches the retarget.

### Why

- The live Cerebras catalog dropped `zai-glm-4.7` and now ships only `gemma-4-31b` and `gpt-oss-120b`. The old default failed `every bundled provider default resolves in its catalog` after `hydrate:model-data` / `release:local` regeneration, which blocked the release smoke.
- `gpt-oss-120b` is present in both the committed snapshot and the live regenerated catalog, so the default stays resolvable across regen.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `defaultModelPerProvider` is a core-owned exhaustive `Record<KnownProvider, string>` used by initial model selection. There is no extension hook for bundled provider defaults.

### Expected merge-conflict zones

- LOW: the `cerebras` row in `defaultModelPerProvider` and the matching pin in `test/model-resolver.test.ts`.

## Cursor CLI OAuth provider display name (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `provider-display-names.ts`: added `"cursor-cli-oauth": "Cursor CLI (OAuth)"` for the new builtin
  provider lane. The `/login` list and auth status surfaces pick the name up automatically from the
  provider registration; only the display-name map needed a row. The lane's builtin registry entry is
  recorded in `extensions/builtin/changes.md` (this directory's nearest record for that file).

### Why

- The lane runs senpi turns through the official `cursor-agent` CLI in print mode as the documented
  fallback for the native Cursor provider (`cursor`, the api2.cursor.sh protobuf transport): use the
  native provider by default, and this lane when the native path misbehaves or Cursor's own agent
  harness is explicitly wanted.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The display-name map is a core-owned literal with no extension hook: a builtin provider cannot name
  itself on the `/login` surface without an entry here. All lane behavior lives under
  `extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/` (see that directory's `changes.md` and `AGENTS.md`).

### Expected merge-conflict zones

- LOW: `provider-display-names.ts` map rows (one-line additions in a sorted literal).

## Repository audit baseline for the core tracker (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- This entry is the canonical inventory for the repository-wide changes.md audit (`scripts/audit-changes-md.mjs`, pin
  `914cf1472e715297caa30db4b9535d534a9eb718`). It assigns every audited production path whose exact nearest tracker is
  this file, so the audit gate can resolve each divergence even where the per-feature history below predates the gate.
- Session and services surface: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-services.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`.
- Persistence and identity: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/messages.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`.
- Model runtime surface: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-config.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-provider.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/runtime-credentials.ts`.
- Resources and packaging: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/package-manager.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/pi-manifest.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/project-trust.ts`.
- Auth and output safety: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/auth-storage.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/bash-executor.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/output-guard.ts`.
- Process-level surfaces: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/event-bus.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/experimental.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/http-dispatcher.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/telemetry.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/timings.ts`.
- Invocation surfaces: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/prompt-templates.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resolve-config-value.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts`.
- Rendering and branding: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/export-html/index.ts`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/export-html/template.css`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/export-html/template.js`,
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-attribution.ts`.
- Deleted upstream surface retained as a tracked divergence: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/index.ts`.

### Why

- The audit compares HEAD against the pinned upstream commit and requires every upstream-owned production divergence
  to be covered by one entry with all four canonical sections in its exact nearest tracker. Paths that only ever appeared
  in undated or partial-form entries were reported uncovered by the pre-backfill audit; this inventory closes that gap
  without rewriting the accurate per-feature history below.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Tracker coverage is repository and release policy, not runtime behavior; it is enforced by repository scripts before
  any extension loader exists.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- NONE: this tracker file merges to `ours` on upstream sync; the inventory intentionally names pin-relative paths so it
  stays valid as entries below change.

## Session runtime launch profiles and removed-extension reporting (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `agent-session-runtime.ts`: new immutable `AgentSessionLaunchProfile` (cwd, permission preset, creation model,
  initial thinking level) captured at first launch and threaded through every replacement route — new, resume, fork,
  and branch switch — via the runtime factory options, so a replaced session keeps the flags the runtime was launched
  with.
- `agent-session-runtime.ts`: `teardownCurrent()` snapshots the outgoing extension runner's identities; `apply()` now
  diffs them against the new runner's resolved paths and emits one `session_extensions_removed` event (with the
  replacement reason) on the old runner. `apply()` became async to await that emission. Runners without
  `getExtensionIdentities` (test hosts, partial implementations) skip reporting instead of breaking replacement.
- `agent-session-services.ts`: `AgentSessionServices` now exposes `authStorage` and `modelRegistry`;
  `createAgentSessionServices()` constructs the `AuthStorage` for `<agentDir>/auth.json`, passes it into
  `ModelRuntime.create()` as its credential store, and wraps the runtime in a `ModelRegistry`.
- `agent-session-services.ts`: pending provider registrations (config-form and native) are replayed through one
  ordered `drainPendingProviderRegistrations()` drain so last-registration-wins holds across mixed registration
  kinds, replacing the two separate reset-after loops.
- `agent-session-services.ts`: duplicate extension flags resolve first-registration-wins; `scopedModels` and the new
  `favoriteModels` option carry a per-model `serviceTier`; `autoTitleSessions` is plumbed to session creation.

### Why

- Session replacement silently dropped the launch-time flags a runtime was created with, and extensions had no signal
  that their host session was being swapped out from under them — the old runner observed `session_shutdown` but
  consumers of the removed extension could not distinguish removal from reload.
- Services were constructing auth and model state twice (runtime-internal and caller-side), and mixed legacy/native
  provider registrations could interleave so a native provider registered earlier lost to a later config form.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Runtime replacement and service construction happen before and beneath the extension runner; an extension cannot
  observe the outgoing runner's identity set or re-order provider registration drains that install it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session-runtime.ts` `teardownCurrent()`/`apply()` and the `launchProfile` threading on every
  `createRuntime()` call site.
- LOW: `agent-session-services.ts` service assembly and the registration drain loop.

## Event bus provider-scope binding and extension RPC channel (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `event-bus.ts`: `createEventBus()` wraps every subscribed handler with `bindToProviderScope()` from
  `@earendil-works/pi-ai/node/provider-scope`, so ambient provider scope established on the emitting side propagates
  through event dispatch; a binding failure falls back to the raw handler.
- `event-bus.ts`: exports the `senpi:extension-rpc-event` channel constant (`EXTENSION_RPC_EVENT_CHANNEL`) and the
  `ExtensionRpcEvent` shape used to relay extension-originated events to RPC hosts.

### Why

- Handlers dispatched on the shared bus otherwise lost the emitting session's provider scope (credentials, request
  context), and RPC hosts needed one named channel contract instead of a string literal duplicated per caller.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The bus is constructed by core before extensions load; scope binding must wrap the handler at subscription time,
  which only the bus itself can do.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `event-bus.ts` `on()` wrapper; the channel constant is fork-owned.

## Brand-scoped environment flags and programmatic timings (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `experimental.ts`: experimental-feature gating reads the branded `envValue("EXPERIMENTAL")` flag instead of
  `process.env.PI_EXPERIMENTAL`.
- `telemetry.ts`: install-telemetry gating reads `envValue("TELEMETRY")` instead of `process.env.PI_TELEMETRY`.
- `timings.ts`: timing enablement reads `envValue("TIMING")`; the `reload` namespace joins `main`/`extensions`;
  exported `TimingEntry` plus `getTimings()`/`formatTimings()` give hosts programmatic access to the same data
  `printTimings()` writes to stderr.

### Why

- Fork environment flags are `SENPI_*`-branded via `brand.ts`, so every `PI_*` read had to move through the one
  branded resolver; timings additionally needed a machine-readable form for hosts that capture startup profiles
  without parsing stderr.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- These modules are imported by the bootstrap path before extension loading and by code that must stay loader-free;
  they cannot depend on extension-provided configuration.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: one env read per file; `timings.ts` accessor block is additive.

## HTML export: provider-native blocks, current skill invocations, tilde paths (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `export-html/index.ts`: explicit output paths expand `~` through `expandTildePath()` in both
  `exportSessionToHtml()` and `exportFromFile()`; default names are unchanged.
- `export-html/template.js`: `parseSkillBlock()` recognizes the current chained skill-invocation format
  (`The user explicitly invoked … <skill-instruction> … <user-request>`) in addition to the legacy `<skill>` block,
  validating that the invocation and instruction names agree; kept in sync with core `agent-session.ts` so standalone
  exports render skill turns the same way live sessions do.
- `export-html/template.js`: assistant `providerNative` blocks render as a collapsible `<details>` element with the
  provider name, subtype, and a 2000-character collapsed preview over the full JSON body.
- `export-html/template.css`: styles for the provider-native collapsible block.

### Why

- Sessions exported after the skill-invocation format changed rendered skill turns as plain user text, and
  provider-native replay content was dropped entirely from exports because the renderer had no arm for it.
- `~/exports/session.html` failed with a literal tilde directory.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The exporter renders from a session file with no runtime present; it is a static template executed in the exported
  HTML, outside any extension lifecycle.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `export-html/index.ts` output-path branches; MEDIUM: `template.js` renderer arms and `parseSkillBlock()`
  (upstream evolves skill formatting); LOW: additive `template.css` rules.

## Multi-session RPC guards for the shared HTTP dispatcher (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `http-dispatcher.ts`: in `--multi-session` processes, `applyHttpProxySettings()` refuses to change an already-set
  `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` value and `configureHttpDispatcher()` pins one process-global idle timeout; both mismatch
  paths throw with an explicit "fixed at process startup" error instead of silently replacing the earlier setting.

### Why

- Multi-session RPC hosts share one process-global Undici `EnvHttpProxyAgent` dispatcher; a second session applying
  its own proxy or timeout would reconfigure every other session's transport mid-flight.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The dispatcher is installed as the global `fetch` replacement during CLI bootstrap, before extensions load, and is
  process-global by construction — no extension can scope it per session.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: guard blocks at the top of `applyHttpProxySettings()` and `configureHttpDispatcher()`.

## Core barrel removal (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- Deleted `packages/coding-agent/src/core/index.ts`, the barrel that re-exported `AgentSession`, the runtime/services
  factories, the bash executor, the event bus, `createSyntheticSourceInfo`, and the extension type surface.
- Consumers import from the concrete modules (`agent-session.ts`, `agent-session-runtime.ts`,
  `agent-session-services.ts`, `extensions/index.ts`) instead.

### Why

- The barrel was a frozen snapshot of the public surface: every fork addition had to be mirrored into it or it
  silently exported a stale alias, and it duplicated the extension API re-exports that `extensions/index.ts` already
  owns. Removing it leaves one authoritative import path per module.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Not runtime behavior: an unused re-export layer cannot be provided or removed by an extension.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: upstream additions to the barrel resurrect it on sync; keep the deletion and port new re-exports to their
  concrete consumer imports.

## Hooks as a packaged resource and legacy `.pi` discovery (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `pi-manifest.ts`: `PiManifest` gains an optional `hooks: string[]` field and `RESOURCE_FIELDS` includes `hooks`, so
  packaged hook resources are listed and validated like extensions, skills, prompts, and themes.
- `package-manager.ts`: `hooks` becomes a fifth resource type (`.json` file pattern) with user and project hook
  directories, global and project settings lists, `ResolvedPaths.hooks`, and accumulator handling.
- `package-manager.ts`: when the legacy project base dir (`.pi`) differs from the canonical one, its auto-discovered
  extensions, skills, prompts, themes, and hooks are still collected under legacy path metadata.
- `package-manager.ts`: offline detection reads the branded `envValue("OFFLINE")` flag instead of `PI_OFFLINE`.

### Why

- Hook plugins ship in packages alongside the other resource kinds and need the same install/update/listing pipeline;
  projects created before the config-directory rename must keep resolving resources from their existing `.pi` tree.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Package installation, resource enumeration, and manifest validation run in the package manager before any
  extension (including hook plugins) can load.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `package-manager.ts` resource maps (`FILE_PATTERNS`, dirs, overrides) — every resource literal list gains a
  `hooks` entry on sync; LOW: `pi-manifest.ts` field list.

## Slash commands, prompt-template metadata, and skill guidance (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `slash-commands.ts`: builtin command list gains `favorite-models` (manage favorites for Ctrl+P cycling) and `exit`
  (alias of `/quit`).
- `prompt-templates.ts`: new `expandPromptTemplateWithMetadata()` returns `{ text, template }` so callers can emit
  invocation metadata for the template they actually expanded; `expandPromptTemplate()` remains as a thin wrapper.
- `skills.ts`: the prompt skill-listing guidance now tells the model to load a skill whenever its description even
  loosely matches the task (loading an irrelevant skill costs little; missing a relevant one degrades the work), and
  documents the default global skill directory (`~/.senpi/agent`).

### Why

- Favorites needed a discoverable command surface next to `scoped-models`; `/exit` matches shell muscle memory.
- Invocation telemetry and session events need to know which template was expanded, not just the expanded text.
- The old skill guidance ("when the task matches its description") under-triggered: agents skipped relevant skills
  on loose matches.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `BUILTIN_SLASH_COMMANDS` and the skill listing are baked into the core prompt/command surface; template expansion
  metadata is produced inside the core expansion function every caller shares.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: additive list entries and the wrapper split in `prompt-templates.ts`.

## Provider attribution branding (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `provider-attribution.ts`: default OpenRouter attribution sends `X-OpenRouter-Title: <APP_NAME>` instead of `pi`,
  and the Cloudflare `User-Agent` is `<APP_NAME>-coding-agent` instead of `pi-coding-agent`; types import from
  `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat`.

### Why

- Hardcoded `pi` strings leaked the upstream product identity on every attributed request; deriving both from
  `APP_NAME` keeps attribution consistent with the fork's published name.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Default attribution headers are applied by the runtime for models that have no configured headers, before any
  extension can decorate the request.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: two header literals in `getDefaultAttributionHeaders()`.

## Credential command retry and per-session environment (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `resolve-config-value.ts`: command-backed config values retry up to three attempts with 250 ms / 1000 ms backoff
  (blocking wait) before reporting unresolved, instead of failing on the first attempt.
- `resolve-config-value.ts`: `resolveConfigValue()`/`resolveConfigValueUncached()` accept a per-session `env`; command
  execution spawns with that environment merged over `process.env`, and uncached command results are no longer reused
  across sessions that carry different environments.

### Why

- Auth-broker commands (`omp token …`) are cold-started and fail transiently (lock contention, slow spawn, a racing
  OAuth refresh), and callers escalate an unresolved API key to a hard provider ejection — one blip kicked the session
  off its model with no retry.
- A process-wide cached command result produced under another session's environment is the wrong credential source.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Config-value resolution runs inside model/auth runtime credential probes, beneath the extension loader.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `executeCommandUncached()` retry loop and the `env` plumbing in the two shell-exec helpers.

## SessionManager usage totals, entry identity, and materialized views (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `session-manager.ts`: exported `UsageTotals` and O(1) `getUsageTotals()` — running input/output/cacheRead/cacheWrite/
  cost totals plus the latest cache-hit rate, folded incrementally on assistant-message append and rebuilt on index
  construction; totals cover ALL entries, not just the current branch, matching the footer hot path.
- `session-manager.ts`: runtime message identity — `getSessionContextEntryId()`, `getMessageEntryPosition()`, and
  `getEntryOrder()` map projected context messages back to their durable entry and append order via WeakMaps, so
  compaction boundaries compare by append order rather than provider timestamps.
- `session-manager.ts`: a mutation counter keys memoized materialized views — `getEntries()` returns the same shared
  array between mutations (callers must not mutate it), no-arg `getBranch()` is memoized on (leaf, mutation), and
  `getSessionName()` is O(1) from an incrementally maintained cache.
- `session-manager.ts`: large payloads externalize through the resident string store — entries are stored in
  externalized form and materialized on read (`getEntry`, `getBranch`, `getHeader`), with stats exposed via
  `getResidentStoreStats()`.
- `session-manager.ts`: `model_change` entries carry `reason: "fallback" | "fallback-revert"` plus the original
  provider/model; context restoration keeps the primary model and restores the pre-fallback thinking level, including
  the crashed-inside-the-window case, while a manual switch inside the window keeps the user's level.
- `session-manager.ts`: `buildContextEntries()` skips compaction entries older than the boundary summary (the latest
  summary supersedes them instead of double-counting); added `hasContextMessages()`, `hasThinkingLevelChanges()`, and
  `countCompactions()`; inlined the UUIDv7 generator (no `uuid` dependency); session-directory docs name `~/.senpi`.

### Why

- The footer and RPC usage paths re-summed every assistant usage on each render; compaction classified history by
  payload timestamps that a late-arriving entry could violate; and repeated materialization of unchanged sessions
  dominated read hot paths.
- Fallback windows previously leaked the fallback model's ephemeral thinking level into the restored primary model.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Entry indexing, identity maps, and the mutation counter live inside the append-only store that constructs the
  context every consumer (including extensions) reads from.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `session-manager.ts` index construction and the accessor bodies; LOW: additive helper methods.

## Message identity, context provenance, and transport image budget (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `messages.ts`: every converted message copies context provenance onto its LLM form via `copyContextProvenance()`.
- `messages.ts`: `GOAL_CONTINUATION_MESSAGE_TYPE` messages keep only their latest occurrence in the model context
  (`keepLatestGoalContinuationMessage()` applied in `convertToLlm()`), while `isContextExcludedCustomMessage()` stays
  per-type false so compaction and branch summarization still see the entries.
- `messages.ts`: `CompactionSummaryMessage` carries optional `details` and `createCompactionSummaryMessage()` accepts
  it; the local `compactionSummary` role module-augmentation was dropped in favor of the upstream declaration.
- `messages.ts`: transport image policy — `TRANSPORT_IMAGE_BUDGET_BYTES` (24 MiB), `elideOldImages()` walking
  newest-to-oldest with `alwaysKeepNewest`/`maxHistoricalImages` protection, elision/blocking placeholders with
  consecutive-dedupe, and `convertToLlmForTransport()` applying the `blockImages` setting at request-build time.

### Why

- Provider-native replay and cache-affinity features need stable message-to-context identity across conversion;
  stale goal-continuation markers accumulated one per goal turn and misled later turns; and long sessions with inline
  screenshots exceeded provider request-size walls (Anthropic's 32 MB) with no request-time bound.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- These are the conversion and request-build functions every provider request passes through, including the
  compaction fallback path that runs with no extension participation.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `convertToLlm()` switch arms; LOW: additive transport-image helpers at end of file.

## Shared file-storage lock policy (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `lockfile-policy.ts` (fork-only): one `FILE_STORAGE_LOCK_OPTIONS` (`realpath: false`, `stale: 30 s`,
  `update: 10 s`) for every proper-lockfile acquisition in the file-backed auth and settings stores.
- `auth-storage.ts`: `lockSync()` acquires with the shared policy and stale detection reads its `stale` value;
  credential writes re-read the latest storage content inside `withLock` instead of mutating an in-memory snapshot;
  runtime credential overrides layer over stored credentials for reads and refresh; extension OAuth login builds its
  interaction with a signal; typed exports (`AuthCredential`, `ApiKeyCredential`/`OAuthCredential`, `AuthStatus`,
  `GetApiKeyOptions`) formalize the storage surface.

### Why

- proper-lockfile defaults (`stale: 10 s`, mtime refresh at `stale/2`) let a sync contender classify a live async lock
  as stale in the 10–15 s gap and steal it; divergent per-store windows meant one store could out-vote another's live
  holder. One policy makes no contender able to out-vote a live holder.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The lock windows guard the auth and settings files themselves, which the extension loader reads through; an
  extension cannot change how the files beneath it are locked.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `lockfile-policy.ts` is fork-owned; LOW-MEDIUM: `auth-storage.ts` lock call sites and the withLock bodies.

## Provider composition: ambient auth, extra body, upstream ids (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `provider-composer.ts`: `ExtensionOAuthConfig` gains `check()` (auth health probe) and `resolveAmbient()` — request
  auth for providers whose credentials live outside `auth.json` (an environment token or a CLI the provider shells
  out to), so ambient users resolve instead of hitting "Provider is not configured"; never consulted once a
  credential is stored.
- `provider-composer.ts`: model definitions accept `upstreamModelId`, `serviceTier`, `promptPreset`,
  `recoverTextToolCalls`, `extraBody`, and `cacheRetention`; providers accept `extraBody` and `cacheRetention`; the
  `video` input modality joins `text`/`image`; model overrides support `thinkingLevelMapMode: "replace"` alongside
  the merge default.
- `provider-composer.ts`: `AuthStatus.source` is extended with the header-auth sources; api-key and header auth
  helpers moved to fork-owned `provider-api-key-auth.ts` / `provider-header-auth.ts`; composition pulls
  `transformContext` and `wrapStreamWithToolCallMiddleware` from `pi-ai` so composed providers engage the same
  middleware and context transforms as native ones.

### Why

- Subscription/CLI-based providers had no way to express request auth without pretending to store an OAuth
  credential, and per-model wire fields (upstream ids, service tiers, prompt presets) had no composition path from
  `models.json` or extension providers to the outgoing request.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Composition is the seam that turns an extension's provider description into the `pi-ai` provider object the
  runtime streams through; the fields must exist on the composed model itself.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `ProviderConfigInput` shape and `applyModelOverride()`/`modelFromJson()` bodies — upstream adds model
  fields here regularly; LOW: the fork-owned auth helper modules.

## Model runtime wire identity, availability gating, and registry services (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `model-runtime.ts`: `setWireIdentity(BRAND?.userAgent ?? APP_NAME)` runs at module load so outgoing requests carry
  the fork identity; model refresh gains a `modelRefreshTimeoutMs` (default 15 s); network model refresh requires the
  branded offline flag to be unset AND explicit `allowModelNetwork`.
- `model-runtime.ts`: availability snapshot gating — `hasAvailabilitySnapshot()`/`hasFreshAvailabilitySnapshot()`;
  builtin providers without `refreshModels` and outside the remote catalog's served set keep their local catalog; a
  `createSync()` factory serves legacy `ModelRegistry` callers; `recomposeProvider()` deletes providers disabled in
  `models.json` instead of composing them.
- `model-runtime.ts`: request preparation merges compatibility `extraBody` with caller `extraBody`, rewrites the
  request model id to the configured `upstreamModelId`, applies auth `baseUrl`, and enriches `onPayload` with the
  resolved model and headers; streams wrap with model-recovery.
- `model-registry.ts`: the registry holds its `AuthStorage` (constructor default plus `create()`/`inMemory()`
  factories), answers `getAvailable()`/`hasConfiguredAuth()`/`isUsingOAuth()` from storage plus runtime status when no
  availability snapshot exists, exposes `getUpstreamModelId()`/`getServiceTier()`, falls back to built-in provider
  display names, and returns `extraBody`/`upstreamModelId`/`serviceTier` from `getApiKeyAndHeaders()`.

### Why

- The registry previously derived auth state from the runtime alone, so ambient/stored credentials were invisible
  until a full availability refresh completed; wire identity and per-model wire fields had to be applied at the one
  point every request passes through.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The runtime is the credential-blind model collection every consumer (including extension tooling) resolves
  through; identity and availability policy cannot be layered from a loaded extension.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `model-runtime.ts` `create()`/`createSync()` and `prepareRequest()`; LOW-MEDIUM: `model-registry.ts`
  accessor bodies.

## Resource loader: bundled builtins, generated shims, package dedupe (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `resource-loader.ts`: vendored builtin extension packages resolve from the package root with explicit
  source-tree versus installed-binary path candidates, and bundled builtin factories join user/project extensions
  in one final load set.
- `resource-loader.ts`: global default extensions materialize as generated shims under `<agentDir>/extensions` with
  a banner; existing shims are recognized (including accepted legacy banners) and resolved back to their factory
  instead of reloading as unknown user extensions.
- `resource-loader.ts`: extension paths dedupe by nearest package identity (`package.json` name), so the same
  installed package reached through different paths loads once; CLI `-e`/`-s` resources keep CLI precedence even
  when they resolve through a package manifest.
- `resource-loader.ts`: hooks resolve as a resource kind (`hookPaths`, enabled-hook resources, CLI hook paths);
  `SYSTEM.md`/`APPEND_SYSTEM.md` file discovery was removed in favor of explicit prompt options (see
  `packages/coding-agent/changes.md`); cached extension loading (`loadExtensionsCached`) was replaced by direct
  `loadExtensions()` calls; enabled/disabled builtin extension settings are honored during final-set assembly.

### Why

- Bundled extensions, generated shims, and package-installed duplicates produced multiple loads of one logical
  extension (duplicate commands/tools and confusing reload events), and trust resolution had to preserve builtin
  factories while filtering user extensions.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The loader is what discovers, dedupes, and constructs extensions; it runs before any of them exist.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `resource-loader.ts` resource resolution and the final extension-set assembly; the shim and package-identity
  helpers are fork-owned.

## models.json schema split and provider disablement (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `model-config.ts`: validation and the `ModelsJson*` types moved to fork-owned `model-config-schema.ts`
  (`validateModelsConfig`), with `model-config.ts` re-exporting the types augmented with `samplingParams`; the legacy
  inline typebox schema remains as a commented reference for upstream diffs.
- `model-config.ts`: `ModelConfig` tracks a disabled-provider set, exposes `isProviderDisabled()` for runtime
  composition, accepts provider-level `cacheRetention`, and gained a synchronous `loadSync()` constructor used by
  `ModelRuntime.createSync()`.

### Why

- One schema module is shared by config loading, authoring, and validation surfaces, so a field added for
  `models.json` authoring cannot drift from what the runtime accepts; provider disablement needed a config-level
  switch that composition honors.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `models.json` is parsed during runtime bootstrap before extensions load; extensions register providers through
  the composer, not the config loader.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `model-config.ts` constructor/load paths; NONE: `model-config-schema.ts` is fork-owned.

## Model pattern service tiers and favorites resolution (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `model-resolver.ts`: model patterns gain a service-tier decorator — grammar `<model-pattern>[:<auto|flex|priority>]
  [:<thinking-level>]`, consumed right-to-left with the leftmost (slot-order) occurrence winning, and a full-pattern
  match still tried first because real model ids contain colons.
- `model-resolver.ts`: `resolveModelScopeFromModels()` reports per-pattern `PatternResolution` ownership records
  (`ownedIds` after first-pattern-wins dedupe, unresolved patterns reported rather than dropped) for favorites
  persistence; `ScopedModel`/`ParsedModelResult` carry `serviceTier`.
- `model-resolver.ts`: scope sources accept `ModelRuntime`, `ModelRegistry`, or any `AvailableModelsSource` so a
  caller holding a settled availability snapshot resolves without triggering another scan;
  `getModelNarrowingPatterns()` unifies CLI versus legacy enabled-pattern inputs.
- `model-resolver.ts`: default-model table adds/updates fork providers (`cursor: "auto"`, `opengateway`, `ollama`,
  `alibaba-token-plan`, `zai`/`zai-coding-cn` → `glm-5.2`).

### Why

- Service tiers are per-model wire settings that users select in the same string they type a model in, and favorites
  persistence needs to know exactly which canonical models a stored pattern owns in the current registry.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Pattern parsing runs in CLI argument handling and scope resolution before sessions (and therefore extensions)
  exist.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `parseModelPattern()` recursion and the `ResolveModelScopeResult` assembly; LOW: the default-model table.

## Stderr takeover for hidden diagnostics (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `output-guard.ts`: `takeOverStderr()`/`restoreStderr()` mirror the existing stdout takeover — `process.stderr.write`
  is wrapped, hidden diagnostics are forwarded to a callback, and a callback failure falls back to writing the
  (optionally formatted) original text through the saved writer and surfaces the error via the write callback;
  chunk/encoding handling normalizes `Uint8Array` writes to text.

### Why

- While a TUI owns the terminal, dependency code writing to stderr corrupts the rendered frame the same way stdout
  writes did; the stdout guard had no stderr counterpart, so hidden-diagnostic capture had to intercept each writer
  ad hoc.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The takeover must be installed around the whole process's stderr before rendering begins; extensions load after
  the terminal is already owned.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: additive block after `restoreStdout()`; the stdout takeover above it is the pattern to follow on sync.
## Expand explicit dollar skill tokens and publish invocation metadata (2026-08-16) ([PR #909](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/909))

### What changed

- Skill composition accepts a leading `$name` run alongside `/skill:name`.
- The desktop composer's explicit `$skill:name` token expands even when it appears inline, while bare inline
  dollar tokens such as `$HOME` remain literal.
- Successful expansion emits one ordered `skill_invocation` session event containing each resolved skill's name,
  source path, and `dollar` or `slash` syntax.
- Dollar and slash tokens share the existing duplicate, unknown, file-read, and five-skill cap behavior.
- Token removal preserves unrelated blank lines, indentation, and literal dollar text, and token discovery stops after
  a bounded 64-token prefix while leaving every unprocessed token literal.
- Resolved extension commands and accepted prompt templates emit one `command_invocation` session event after
  extension input interception, so transformed or rejected text cannot be reported as an invocation.

### Why

- OmO Desktop serializes a selected skill chip as `$skill:name`; treating it as prose made the new desktop picker
  look successful while the runtime silently ignored the invocation.
- TUI autocomplete needs a concise leading `$name` form without making arbitrary inline shell variables executable.
- RPC consumers need typed invocation metadata instead of reparsing the expanded user prompt.
- Prompt content outside explicit invocation token spans must remain byte-meaningful for pasted code and structured text.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Prompt, steering, follow-up, RPC, and interactive entry paths must share one pre-provider expansion contract.
- The session event union and prompt expansion boundary are core-owned and run before extensions can safely
  normalize every entry surface.
- Prompt-template resolution metadata is private session state; extensions cannot reliably emit accepted invocation
  events after another extension transforms or handles the original input.

### Expected merge-conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts` skill parsing, prompt-template resolution, command dispatch, queueing, and `AgentSessionEvent`.
- `prompt-templates.ts` expansion metadata.
- Skill-composition and command-invocation regressions under `test/suite/regressions/`.

## Cursor exec bridge (2026-08-16)

### What changed

- `cursor-exec-bridge.ts` (new): maps Cursor exec-channel frames onto the session's real tools through the
  same wrapped `AgentTool.execute` path model-issued calls use. Legacy frames map read→`read`
  (offset/limit kwargs), ls→`ls`, grep→`grep`, write→`write`, shell→`bash` (workingDirectory composed as a
  quoted `cd` prefix; senpi's bash has no cwd kwarg); modern Pi frames map 1:1 (`pi_edit` →
  `edits[{oldText,newText}]`, `pi_grep` flags, `pi_find` → `find`, `pi_ls` → `ls` with `limit`); MCP calls
  dispatch by tool name. Args are validated with `validateToolArguments` before execution; every valid call
  emits `tool_execution_start`, runs the session's vetoable extension `tool_call` preflight (including mutable
  input and first-block semantics), and emits a matching `tool_execution_end`. Blocked calls return the reason
  as an in-band error without invoking the tool. `delete`, `diagnostics`, and `mcpApprovalPreflight` handlers
  are deliberately absent (typed refusals on the wire).
- `cursor-exec-bridge-session.ts` (new): owns the late-bound session/Agent wiring. Tools resolve through the
  session's full registry, preflight delegates to `AgentSession.preflightToolCall`, lifecycle events ride
  `agent.emitExternalEvent`, and the active Agent signal remains the abort source.
- `sdk.ts`: replaces the inline bridge options with one `createSessionCursorExecBridge(...)` call, reducing the
  already-large session factory while preserving its post-Agent session-ref assignment.
- `agent-session.ts`: `getRegisteredTool()` exposes the full registry (builtin + extension tools) because Cursor
  drives its native tools over the exec channel regardless of the request's advertised set. The existing
  `_emitBeforeToolCallHooks` implementation is renamed `preflightToolCall`; its event-queue wait guarantees
  lifecycle correlation is visible before Cursor preflight.

### Why

- Cursor's protocol executes tools server-drivenly mid-stream; without the bridge every Cursor turn that
  touches a tool would stall and time out. Without the shared preflight, server-driven calls bypassed extension
  vetoes such as permission policy and loop-guard hard escalation.

### Why an extension could not do this

- The bridge must be wired into the Agent's loop config before any extension loads, and it needs the wrapped
  tool registry (approvals, sandboxing, truncation) rather than raw tool definitions.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `sdk.ts` Agent construction options (additive), `agent-session.ts` additive accessor.
- NONE expected in `cursor-exec-bridge.ts`: fork-only file.

## Cursor provider display name (2026-08-16)

### What changed

- `provider-display-names.ts`: added `cursor: "Cursor"` for the new builtin Cursor OAuth provider
  (`packages/ai/src/providers/cursor.ts`). The `/login` list and auth status surfaces pick the name up
  automatically from the provider registration; only the display-name map needed a row.

### Why

- Without the entry the provider id would render raw ("cursor") in provider name surfaces that consult
  `BUILT_IN_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAMES`.

### Why an extension could not do this

- The display-name map for builtin providers is a core lookup table, not an extension surface.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the alphabetical map in `provider-display-names.ts` when upstream adds providers.

## JSONC settings parser, precedence, and write ownership (2026-08-16)

### What changed

- `settings-manager.ts` now strips line/block comments only outside quoted strings, removes trailing commas before object/array closers, and delegates final validation to `JSON.parse`; no dependency was added.
- File storage selects `settings.jsonc` before `settings.json`, retains that selected path for writes, and reselects only at create/reload/project-trust load boundaries.
- Selected-source metadata includes path, format, reason, and scope; `AgentSession` forwards reload decisions and replays startup decisions once to each host subscriber.

### Why

- A per-write filesystem probe could redirect a session to another flavor after load, while JSON-only parsing prevented maintainable commented settings. Selection boundaries make precedence and write ownership explicit.

### Why an extension could not do this

- Parsing and locking happen before extensions load, and the session emitter is the shared transport boundary used by RPC and TUI hosts.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `settings-manager.ts` path/storage/load/save sections.
- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` event and subscription lifecycle.

## Model and service-tier session events (2026-08-16)

### What changed

- `AgentSessionEvent` gained `model_changed` (model, post-switch thinking level, `ModelSelectSource`) and `service_tier_changed` (tier, fastMode). Both are emitted from the existing switch seams: `_switchActiveModel`, `_cycleFavoriteModel`, and `setSessionFastMode`.
- `service_tier_changed` fires only when the effective tier or the fast-mode indicator actually moved (they move independently).
- New read-only accessors: `cwd` (the value extensions already receive as `ctx.cwd`) and `effectiveServiceTier` (`serviceTier`, promoted to `"priority"` while session fast mode is on — what the wire actually carries).

### Why

- Host surfaces (RPC) had to infer the active model from session entries and could not see tier or fast-mode state at all. Emitting at the switch seams means every path — command, slash command, cycle, fallback, restore — reports the level actually in force afterwards, which per-model memory makes different from the requested level.
- `effectiveServiceTier` exists so a client can never be shown `fastMode: true` alongside a tier that disagrees with it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Model switching, thinking-level clamping, and tier resolution are session-core state transitions; an extension observing `model_select` cannot report the post-clamp level atomically with the switch.

## /fast per-model service-tier persistence seam (2026-08-16)

### What changed

- `setSessionFastMode(false)` now also clears a cached `"priority"` `_currentServiceTier` when the active model is a codex-responses model AND that priority is inherited from the catalog (`getCompatibilityRequestConfig(model).serviceTier === "priority"`). A priority the catalog does not explain is an explicit scoped/favorite `:priority` pin and is left alone. `_resolveServiceTier` is unchanged.

### Why

`/fast` now persists per model (see `extensions/builtin/changes.md`), and turning it off writes a remembered `"auto"` that must override an inherited catalog-priority tier immediately. The resolved tier is only recomputed on model switches, so a same-session `/fast off` (which deliberately does not swap models) would otherwise keep the badge on and keep sending `service_tier: "priority"` until a restart. The memory itself is applied in the service-tier extension (which holds the fresh settings read); caching it here instead would survive the off and leak the inherited tier back onto the wire.

## Preserve per-model reasoning effort while reasoning is off (2026-08-16)

### What changed

- `SettingsManager` now persists `modelLastOnThinkingLevels` beside `modelThinkingLevels`.
- Every non-off per-model thinking write refreshes the companion value; writing `off` changes only the effective
  level, so startup remains off while a later `/reasoning on` can restore the previous effort.
- The companion accessor validates runtime JSON and marks only the nested model key for concurrent-session merges.

### Why

- Persisting `off` into the only per-model field destroyed the effort the user expected to restore. A
  session-scoped fallback hid that loss only until restart, making the same off/on sequence produce different
  results before and after a restart.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Ordinary thinking-level changes and startup restoration already flow through core settings. The remembered
  non-off value must therefore be a storage invariant rather than extension-process state.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `settings-manager.ts` beside the existing per-model thinking accessors.

## Clamp fallback thinking levels canonically and restore the pre-fallback level (2026-08-16)

### What changed

- `retry-fallback/controller.ts` `selectThinking()` now delegates to `clampThinkingLevel` from
  `@earendil-works/pi-ai` instead of falling back to the last (highest) supported level.
- `session-manager.ts` `getSessionContextSettings()` captures the thinking level in effect when a fallback
  window opens and restores it on `fallback-revert`, or at the end of the path when the window never closed.
  A manual `model_change` still abandons the window, keeping the in-window level for the newly chosen model.

### Why

- The old fallback clamp escalated: a requested `off` against an always-on fallback model resolved to that
  model's maximum level, silently spending the largest reasoning budget on an unattended retry. The canonical
  clamp walks to the nearest supported level in either direction.
- Session restoration already protected the model half of a fallback window (`originalProvider`/`originalModelId`)
  but assigned `thinking_level_change` unconditionally, so a session interrupted inside a window came back with
  the primary model and the fallback model's ephemeral thinking level.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Both sites are core reducers: the retry controller picks the level before any extension observes the switch, and
  session context restoration runs while rebuilding state from the session file.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `retry-fallback/controller.ts` `selectThinking()`; `session-manager.ts` `getSessionContextSettings()`.

## Skip pi.dev catalog overlay for fork-only builtin providers (2026-08-16)

### What changed

- `remote-catalog-provider.ts` exports `FORK_ONLY_BUILTIN_PROVIDERS` (`alibaba-token-plan`, `opengateway`) and
  `remoteCatalogServesProvider(providerId, catalogBaseUrl?)`.
- `model-runtime.ts` `create` and `createSync` skip the `withRemoteCatalog` wrap for fork-only builtin providers
  when the default upstream catalog base URL is in use. A custom `catalogBaseUrl` keeps the wrap, so a fork-owned
  catalog could serve these providers later.

### Why

- pi.dev is upstream infrastructure and does not serve fork-only provider ids. It answers them with a non-404
  failure, which surfaced as a chronic `Could not refresh <id>; showing cached models` warning on every
  model-selector refresh: transient-failure persists never write `lastModified`, so the four-hour freshness
  throttle never engaged for always-failing providers.
- Fork-only catalogs are already baked at build time, so skipping the overlay loses nothing.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The wrap is applied inside `ModelRuntime` construction over the core-owned builtin provider list, before any
  extension registers providers; extensions cannot unwrap a builtin.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `model-runtime.ts` at the two `withRemoteCatalog` wrap sites; `remote-catalog-provider.ts` near the
  top-level constants.

## Let a superseding compaction claim pass admission quietly (2026-08-16)

### What changed

- New private `AgentSession._hasSupersedingCompactionClaim()`: true when a live (non-aborted)
  compaction or auto-compaction controller is currently claimed. Compaction claims are
  last-writer-wins (`_claimCompactionController` aborts the incumbent), so after an admission
  compaction loses that race, the winner owns the route and re-gates admission itself.
- The guard joins `_isCompactionOnCooldown()` / `_isCompactionDelegated()` at the admission-family
  `RequiredCompactionError` sites: `_enforceCompactionBeforeProvider`,
  `_enforceFinalProviderAdmission`, `_checkCompaction`'s inline overflow throw,
  `_revalidateScheduledContinuationAdmission`, and the pre-retry compaction gate
  ([#886](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/886)).
- User-initiated aborts keep throwing: `abortCompaction()` aborts the claimed controllers without
  registering a replacement, so no live claimant exists and the guard stays false.

### Why

- On a resumed over-threshold session, a queued extension message (goal continuation, ttsr nudge)
  races the user's own prompt; both run pre-prompt admission and the loser's compaction is aborted
  mid-flight. Treating that abort like a failure threw
  `Context remains above the compaction threshold because compaction did not complete` at the
  losing caller (surfaced as `Runtime error (send_message)`), even though a newer compaction was
  actively running. This mirrors the breaker-cooldown (#531) and SDK-delegation (#874) precedent:
  when compaction cannot complete for a transient/ownership reason, admission proceeds and
  overflow recovery remains the safety net.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Required-compaction admission and the compaction controller registry are private `AgentSession`
  state; extensions observe only the thrown error.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts` around `_isCompactionOnCooldown` and each guarded
  `throw new RequiredCompactionError()` site.

## Admit provider-owned compaction lanes (2026-08-14)

### What changed

- `CompactionRejectionCause` now includes `external-owner`, with an exhaustive fallback description for rejection
  events that do not carry an extension reason.
- `AgentSession` treats a failed `external-owner` compaction as delegated only while the lifecycle's recorded model
  provider matches the active provider. Delegated failures neither throw `RequiredCompactionError`, block final or
  retry admission, nor arm `_blockedPostCompactionAssistant`.
- Circuit-breaker cooldown semantics remain unchanged: its final-admission bypass still requires the post-attempt
  estimate to fall below the threshold, while delegated lanes may proceed despite Senpi's unreliable oversize
  estimate.

### Why

- SDK-native provider lanes compact inside the admitted query. Rejecting the core compaction route is an ownership
  handoff, not a failed prerequisite, so stopping before provider dispatch prevents the component that owns
  compaction from doing its work.
- Failed lifecycle state survives model selection. Matching the recorded provider prevents a delegated rejection
  from one provider from suppressing required-compaction errors after switching to another provider.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Required-compaction admission, retry gating, lifecycle model identity, and blocked-assistant recovery are private
  `AgentSession` state. An extension can report ownership but cannot alter these core gates.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts`, around required-compaction admission, final provider admission, post-compaction blocking,
  scheduled continuation revalidation, and retry admission.
- LOW: `extensions/types.ts`, in the shared compaction rejection-cause union.

## Catalog listing and atomic fallback-chain overrides (2026-08-13)

### What changed

- `--list-models` reads the registered model snapshot without filtering out
  models whose credentials are not configured.
- Project `retry.fallbackChains` replaces the global map atomically while
  sibling retry settings continue to merge recursively.
- Native provider replacement synchronizes its composed OAuth adapter into the
  credential store, preserving auth-derived request metadata such as Copilot
  enterprise base URLs.
- Core summarization resolves stored provider auth before invoking SDK-style or
  custom stream wrappers, so account-specific request metadata is not replaced
  by a legacy catalog key.

### Why

- Model listing is a discovery fast path used before login.
- Fallback chains are ordered policy maps; retaining unrelated global keys
  changes project-specific retry behavior.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- CLI fast-path model discovery and settings precedence run before extensions.
- OAuth adapter composition belongs to the core model runtime and credential
  store boundary.
- Summarization auth is assembled inside `AgentSession` before extensions or
  stream wrappers receive the request.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `cli/list-models.ts`, around catalog selection.
- MEDIUM: `settings-manager.ts`, around global/project deep merge behavior.
- MEDIUM: `model-runtime.ts`, around native provider registration and OAuth
  adapter replacement.
- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts`, around summarization request auth.

## Compaction terminal-state and retry recovery parity (2026-08-13)

### What changed

- Successful manual compaction now clears its controller before publishing
  `compaction_end`, so listeners observe a terminal state and may queue prompts.
- Prompt admission failures during manual compaction report
  `preflightResult(false)`.
- Recoverable length-stopped assistants are removed before the post-compaction
  continuation, matching error-stopped recovery.
- Summarization reuses an active request API key for ordinary key-auth providers
  while preserving stored OAuth resolution and its account-specific base URL.

### Why

- The merged lifecycle emitted completion while `isCompacting` was still true,
  omitted the preflight rejection callback, and retained truncated assistants
  that prevented the scheduled retry from reaching the provider.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Prompt admission, lifecycle publication, and continuation message ownership
  are private `AgentSession` state transitions.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts`, around `isCompacting`, `prompt()`, successful
  `_executeCompaction()` completion, and `_runAutoCompaction()` continuation.

## Node built-in auth-storage timer import (2026-08-13)

### What changed

- Normalized the auth-storage retry delay import to `node:timers/promises`.

### Why

- Vitest's module runner can resolve bare `timers/promises` relative to an
  aliased package root, breaking codemode suites that import the coding-agent
  source graph.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Auth storage is loaded as core module code before extensions can intercept
  module resolution.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `auth-storage.ts`, in the Node timer import used by bounded retries.

## Historical image transport limits (2026-08-12)

### What changed

- Added `images.maxHistoricalImages` to limit how many images from completed
  turns are replayed to providers.
- Images in the active turn remain intact. Older images are replaced only in
  the provider request payload with the existing recoverable elision marker;
  persisted session history is unchanged.

### Why

- Long coding sessions could resend tens of megabytes of already-processed
  screenshots on every request, increasing upload cost and vision prefill even
  when the active turn contained no image.
- The setting is opt-in and removing it restores the previous replay behavior.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Elision runs inside the core-owned transport conversion before provider
  dispatch and below extension payload hooks.
- The `images.*` setting and the request conversion are both core `Settings`
  and SDK responsibilities.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `messages.ts`, in the historical-image counting and elision loop.
- LOW: `settings-manager.ts`, in the `images.*` schema and getter.
- MEDIUM: `sdk.ts`, where `convertToLlmForTransport()` forwards the limit into
  the upstream-owned block-image conversion path.

## Extension OAuth runtime credential overlay (2026-08-13)

### What changed

- Preserved `asExtensionOAuthRegistry`, which overlays extension-registered
  OAuth providers onto the core runtime credential registry.

### Why

- Builtin and third-party OAuth extensions need to participate in model
  credential resolution without replacing the core credential store.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The overlay is the core boundary that turns extension registrations into the
  credential interface consumed by model runtime and auth preflight.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `runtime-credentials.ts`, around the registry wrapper and provider
  lookup delegation.

## OpenGateway display name for /login (2026-08-12)

### What changed

- `BUILT_IN_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAMES` maps `opengateway` to `OpenGateway`, which makes the new
  built-in provider API-key eligible in the `/login` and `/logout` selectors on both the TUI and
  RPC provider lists.
- `defaultModelPerProvider` gains the required `opengateway` entry (`moonshotai/kimi-k3`) so the
  exhaustive `Record<KnownProvider, string>` map stays total.

### Why

- `isApiKeyLoginProvider()` treats a built-in model provider without a display name as ineligible
  for API-key login; the display-name entry is the single switch that exposes the provider.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `provider-display-names.ts` display-name map.

## Ambient auth resolution honours the request signal (2026-08-13)

### What changed

- `ExtensionOAuthConfig.resolveAmbient()` (`provider-composer.ts`) accepts an optional `signal` alongside `ctx`.
- The ambient-only api-key auth in `provider-api-key-auth.ts` forwards the `AbortSignal` that `ApiKeyAuth.check`
  and `ApiKeyAuth.resolve` already receive, so an abandoned request stops waiting on ambient resolution.

### Why

- Ambient resolution can shell out to a provider CLI, which runs on the auth path of every request. Without the
  signal an aborted turn still waited for that work to settle.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `resolveAmbient` signature in `provider-composer.ts` and the ambient auth callsites in
  `provider-api-key-auth.ts`.

## Compose ambient api-key auth for OAuth providers (2026-08-12)

### What changed

- `ExtensionOAuthConfig` (`provider-composer.ts`) gained an additive optional `resolveAmbient()` hook for providers
  whose credentials live outside `auth.json` — an environment token, or a CLI the provider shells out to.
- `composeApiKeyAuth` (`provider-api-key-auth.ts`) previously returned `undefined` for a provider with no inherited
  auth, no configured key and no configured headers whenever `oauth` was present. It now returns ambient-only
  api-key auth built from `resolveAmbient()` when the OAuth config supplies one, and still returns `undefined`
  otherwise. The composed auth deliberately omits `login`, so the OAuth flow keeps ownership of login, and it
  declines whenever a credential is passed, so a stored credential always wins.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- `resolveProviderAuth()` in `pi-ai` reads ambient credentials exclusively through `provider.auth.apiKey.resolve()`.
  A provider that registers only `oauth` is therefore unresolvable with an empty `auth.json`, no matter what the
  extension does: the composer discards its ambient credentials before `Models.getAuth()` runs. Availability and
  resolution then disagree, because `Models.checkProviderAuth()` falls back to `oauth.check()` with no credential —
  the provider advertises models it cannot authenticate, and every request fails
  `Provider is not configured: <id>`.
- This restores the resolution path that `apiKey: "claude-sdk-oauth-managed"` provided before 2acbb6e0c, without
  restoring its false availability: the synthesized auth resolves only when the provider's own ambient probe says so,
  where the literal sentinel reported configured unconditionally.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the additive `ExtensionOAuthConfig.resolveAmbient` field in `provider-composer.ts`.
- LOW: the early-return branch at the top of `composeApiKeyAuth` in `provider-api-key-auth.ts`.

## Retire extension generations after reload notifications (2026-08-12)

### What changed

- Session reload invalidates the previous `ExtensionRunner` after removed-extension notifications
  have been delivered, including when notification delivery throws.

### Why

- Reload replaced the active runner but left captured references to the previous generation callable.
  Invalidating after the final old-generation lifecycle event preserves notification behavior while
  closing later request registration, emission, and dispatch.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` reload lifecycle ordering.

## Standalone binary codemode sidecar resolution (2026-08-11)

### What changed

- `resource-loader.ts` now loads codemode through a statically imported
  extension factory in compiled Bun binaries, while retaining an explicit
  `node_modules/@code-yeongyu/senpi-codemode/package.json` sidecar lookup for
  source/runtime assets and non-compiled package resolution.
- Source and npm installations retain their existing workspace/package
  resolution paths and builtin ordering.
- Standalone relocation smoke now initializes classic RPC and requires one
  enabled `codemode` extension at `<builtin:codemode>` in
  `get_loaded_surfaces`.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Bun's compiled `$bunfs` `createRequire()` cannot resolve an external package
  beside the executable, and Jiti-loaded sidecar source cannot resolve its
  package dependencies back into the compiled host. The trusted
  builtin-adjacent loader must embed the factory while the distribution keeps
  worker and prelude assets beside the executable.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `resource-loader.ts` around bundled builtin package resolution.
- LOW: standalone binary relocation smoke coverage.

## Preserve extension OAuth availability checks (2026-08-11)

### What changed

- Extension provider OAuth configs can expose the additive `check()` availability hook from `pi-ai`.
- `provider-composer.ts` carries that hook through `adaptOAuth()` so the canonical model runtime can classify stored
  sentinel credentials and ambient OAuth sources without provider-specific core branches.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Extension registration is normalized into canonical provider auth inside the core composer; without this adapter
  field, the provider's hook is discarded before `Models.checkAuth()` runs.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the additive `ExtensionOAuthConfig.check` field and `adaptOAuth()` spread in `provider-composer.ts`.

## Refresh server-fallback policy for active-turn model changes (2026-08-10)

### What changed

- `AgentSession` now recomputes `abortServerSideFallback` in its next-turn refresh snapshot from the live retry
  settings and the newly active model's configured fallback chain.
- Favorite-model cycling during tool execution previously changed the next request's model but left the agent loop's
  run-start server-fallback option unchanged. A Fable request entered from an unchained model could therefore accept
  and persist Anthropic's provider-native Fable-to-Opus fallback instead of routing the refusal through Senpi's
  configured chain.
- The explicit `retry.abortServerSideFallback: false` opt-out remains false after the same in-turn model cycle.
- Coverage reproduces the real request order with a faux tool: unchained model request, favorite cycle during tool
  execution, then a chained-model continuation.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Extensions can trigger or observe model selection, but the live provider option is assembled by agent-core from the
  session's next-turn snapshot before the continuation request is sent.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `_installAgentNextTurnRefresh()` next-turn snapshot fields in `agent-session.ts`.
- LOW: `server-fallback-abort-option.test.ts` continuation-policy coverage.

## Extension filesystem policy binding (2026-08-09)

### What changed

- `AgentSession._buildRuntime()` composes factory-registered filesystem policies once and injects the resulting optional
  checker into Senpi's six built-in file tools.
- Policy absence produces `undefined`, preserving the previous runtime path without per-call extension dispatch.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Only the session runtime constructs the canonical built-in tool definitions and can install a checker below
  permission/approval hooks while keeping extension-overridden custom tools separate.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `_buildRuntime()` around extension result loading and `createAllToolDefinitions()` options.

## Prompt-cache keep-alive and goal backstop settings (2026-08-09)

### What changed

- `settings-manager.ts` gained `promptCache.goalBackstopMaxSeconds` (default 3570) capping the
  cache-derived goal continuation backstop, and `promptCache.keepAlive`
  (`enabled` default false, `maxRequestsPerSession` 3, `maxCostUsdPerSession` 0.05,
  `marginSeconds` 60) governing the opt-in `cache-keepalive` builtin extension.

### Why not an extension

- Both live on `Settings`, which is core-owned; extensions read them through
  `ExtensionContext`, they cannot declare new persisted settings keys themselves.

### Merge-conflict zones

- `PromptCacheSettings` interface and the corresponding getters in `settings-manager.ts`.

## Dispatch extension commands before settled session work (2026-08-09)

### What changed

- Registered extension slash commands now dispatch at the head of `AgentSession.prompt()`, after any
  in-flight user-abort wait but before prompt-start ownership and the settled-session-work gate.
- A synchronous command lookup avoids adding an await or widening prompt-start admission for unknown
  leading-slash text. Handled commands preserve the existing `promptDisposition("handled")` and
  `preflightResult(true)` callbacks; post-handler cancellation reports `preflightResult(false)` and
  rethrows.

### Why

- Extension commands are UI actions, not prompts. Serializing them behind compaction or the
  session-work barrier delayed command output until an active continuation run ended, even though
  the same commands were intended to execute immediately.

### Accepted behavior deltas

- Idle extension commands now skip `_maybeRestoreFallbackPrimary()`. `/fast` and `/fallback` may
  observe a fallback model whose cooldown has expired; the primary is still restored by the next
  real prompt.
- In print mode, a slash command in a scripted `-m` message list executes immediately rather than
  after pending continuations.
- App-server handled-command turn lifecycle behavior is unchanged, but command handling can now
  complete earlier relative to its pre-existing started/user-message events.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The settled-work admission gate and prompt-start bookkeeping live inside `AgentSession.prompt()`;
  an extension command handler cannot run until core dispatch reaches it.
- Expected merge-conflict zone: `agent-session.ts` at the head of `prompt()` around user-abort,
  extension-command dispatch, prompt-start ownership, and settled-work admission.

## Degrade fallback-unavailable 429s to in-turn retry (2026-08-06)

### What changed

- A 429-class failure whose hint tier routes to fallback (`no-hint-fast-fallback`, tier2, tier3) no
  longer fails the turn with `auto_retry_end { attempt: 0 }` when no fallback candidate is usable
  (no chain for the model, chain exhausted, candidates cooling, or unauthenticated).
- No-hint failures degrade to same-model in-turn retries on the ordinary `settings.retry`
  exponential schedule; tier2 hinted waits retry in-turn with the wait clamped to
  `hintedWaitCapMs`; tier3 (>= `probeBackMaxMs`) waits stay terminal but the final error now names
  the provider-requested wait in seconds.
- The pure policy is `degradeWithoutFallback` in `retry-fallback/hint-policy.ts`;
  `agent-session.ts` routes both former instant-death branches through
  `_degradeRateLimitedWithoutFallback`, which also reports the TRUE attempt count on budget
  exhaustion.

### Why

- Providers that send hint-less 429s (e.g. wafer `server_overloaded` bodies that literally say
  "Please retry shortly") killed the turn on the FIRST 429 for any model without a usable fallback
  chain, surfacing "Retry failed after 0 attempts". sst/opencode retries such failures in-turn
  with a visible countdown and openai/codex replays the turn within its stream budget; failing
  with zero attempts was strictly worse than both.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Retry admission, the retry promise, `_retryAttempt` accounting, and the hint tier router live in
  `AgentSession._handleRetryableError`; an extension cannot re-enter the continuation path after
  the fallback controller declines a candidate.
- Expected merge-conflict zone: `agent-session.ts` `_handleRetryableError` 429 tier routing and the
  `retry-fallback/hint-policy.ts` tail.

## Absolute-cap compaction rejection message (2026-08-05)

- `describeCompactionRejection()` for `"per-turn-cap"` now reads "absolute compaction cap reached for
  this session." The cause identifier is unchanged for extension-API stability; only the per-turn soft
  cap was removed (see `extensions/builtin/compaction/changes.md`).
- Expected merge-conflict zone: `agent-session.ts` around `describeCompactionRejection`.

## Bound provider-timeout retry continuations (2026-08-05)

### What changed

- Provider stream/transport timeout retries keep the existing first-request
  option cap, including the rule that disabled ordinary stream guards stay
  disabled.
- A separate retry-continuation watchdog now uses the same positive
  `retry.provider.streamRetryTimeoutMs` budget to abort only the Agent run whose
  signal it captured. A later prompt or low-level takeover cannot be cancelled
  by the stale timer.
- Timeout option planning and watchdog ownership live in
  `provider-timeout-retry.ts`; the oversized `AgentSession` delegates instead of
  absorbing another retry responsibility.

### Why

- A transport error such as `Request timed out.` could start a retry while both
  ordinary stream guards were disabled. If that retry emitted no provider
  events, its detached continuation held the session work barrier and retry
  promise forever, leaving the interactive session visibly Working until the
  process restarted.
- Re-enabling user-disabled stream guards would mask the wedge by changing an
  intentional policy. The retry-owned watchdog supplies liveness without
  changing provider call options.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Only `AgentSession` owns the retry promise, scheduled-continuation barrier,
  active Agent signal, and settled lifecycle. An extension cannot prove that a
  timer still owns the same retry run before aborting it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` scheduled continuation and retry admission wiring.
- LOW: `provider-timeout-retry.ts` timeout option planning and owned-run abort.
- LOW: provider timeout recovery regression file organization.

## Default fallback chains survive user chain configuration (2026-08-04)

### What changed

- `retry-fallback/settings.ts` now layers user `retry.fallbackChains` over
  `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_CHAINS` per key instead of replacing the whole map. A user
  key of the same name still replaces that default outright (never a union), and
  an explicit empty array removes a default the user does not want.
- `retry-fallback/validate.ts` no longer warns that an empty chain "must contain
  at least one entry", because an empty array is now the documented opt-out.
- The malformed-map warning names the offending value
  (`"...but got null."` / `"...but got an array."`) instead of being anonymous.
- `SettingsManager.getFallbackChainsScope()` reports which scope supplied
  `retry.fallbackChains` (project wins, since it replaces the map wholesale), and
  every `validation_warning` log record now carries that scope as `source`, so a
  single log line names the file to open. `source` is `"default"` when no scope
  configured chains and the resolved map is the shipped defaults.

### Why

- Configuring an unrelated model silently deleted every shipped default chain.
  A user who added only `apitopia/kimi-k3-*` chains lost the default
  `anthropic/claude-fable-5` chain without any warning.
- That loss then propagated into policy: with no chain for the active model,
  `hasConfiguredChain()` returned false, the 2026-08-03 server-fallback policy
  correctly disabled `abortServerSideFallback`, and Anthropic's server-side
  substitution replaced the user's intended client fallback. The policy behaved
  as designed; its input was wrong.
- The anonymous "must be a plain object" warning fired repeatedly in real logs
  with no way to identify which value produced it.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Defaults-vs-user resolution happens inside settings resolution, before any
  extension observes a session. An extension can add chains through
  `setFallbackChain`, but cannot restore a default the resolver already dropped.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `retry-fallback/settings.ts` `resolveFallbackChains()`.
- LOW: `retry-fallback/validate.ts` empty-entry branch and the malformed-map string.
- LOW: fallback settings/validate test expectations.

## Durable compaction telemetry correlation (2026-08-03)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts` retains superseded compaction attempt IDs until their stale terminal event arrives, rather than evicting the oldest ID after 64 supersessions.
- A `compaction_end` event without a request ID is now logged as an uncorrelated skipped/no-attempt decision and cannot consume an active same-reason attempt. Request-bearing terminals still require an exact attempt-ID match.
- `test/session-log-routes.test.ts` covers an early stale accepted terminal after more than 64 supersessions and no-ID retry exhaustion while another overflow attempt remains active.

### Why

- FIFO tombstone eviction allowed a late accepted terminal from an old attempt to reappear as a committed compaction after enough supersessions.
- Reason-only fallback correlation let retry exhaustion, which starts no compaction and carries no request ID, falsely mark an unrelated active overflow attempt as failed/compact.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Attempt ownership and session-log emission meet inside `AgentSession._logSessionEvent()` before external telemetry consumers receive the content-free lifecycle record.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `agent-session.ts` compaction start/end logging correlation and `test/session-log-routes.test.ts` lifecycle telemetry coverage.

## Required-compaction continuation recovery (2026-08-03)

### What changed

- `AgentSession` marks only provenance-confirmed required-compaction admission errors as retrying.
- Accepted post-turn threshold compaction resumes the exact interrupted continuation, including queued
  steering input, without fabricating a user `continue`.
- A locally proven required-compaction error can use the persisted byte estimate when every provider
  usage sample is missing or zero.
- Rejected recovery stays terminal, provider errors with the same text do not gain retry provenance,
  and one recovery sequence persists one threshold error.

### Why

- Required admission previously surfaced as a terminal provider failure before the recovery compaction
  finished, leaving active work idle even after a successful compaction.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Only the session runtime owns the interrupted continuation, compaction lifecycle, provider-admission
  ordering, and queued-input precedence.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-session.ts` required-compaction provenance, `_runAutoCompaction()`, and upstream request-ID telemetry.

## Prefer configured client fallback chains over server substitutions (2026-08-03)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts` now enables Anthropic's server-fallback abort only when the
  current model has a configured client fallback chain.
- The policy refreshes before each prompt and after every active-model switch,
  so `/fallback` edits, manual model changes, retry fallbacks, and primary
  restoration cannot carry stale precedence into the next provider request.
- An explicit `retry.abortServerSideFallback: false` still opts out even when a
  client chain exists.

### Why

- The previous session bootstrap enabled the abort unconditionally by default.
  When Anthropic substituted `claude-opus-4-8` for `claude-opus-5` and no client
  chain existed, Senpi discarded the valid substitute response and surfaced an
  error plus a warning telling the user to configure `/fallback`.
- Server fallback should be the default recovery when the user has not selected
  a client policy; an explicit client chain should remain authoritative when it
  exists.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The decision must be forwarded in request-local provider options before the
  Anthropic stream parses a fallback receipt. Extensions can configure chains
  and observe events, but cannot change the agent loop's provider option after
  model selection and before each internal retry continuation.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `agent-session.ts` around `_promptAgent()` and `_switchActiveModel()`.
- LOW: server-fallback option/routing tests.

## Resume queued messages after non-auto compaction; retain admission-rejected custom messages (2026-08-03)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts` gained `_resumeQueuedMessagesAfterCompaction()`, mirroring
  `_runAutoCompaction`'s accepted-path recovery, and calls it on the success
  paths of `applyCompaction()`, the extension `compact` context action, and
  manual `compact()`.
- `sendCustomMessage()`'s non-streaming `triggerTurn` path now retains the
  message in the matching agent-level queue (`followUp`/`steer`) before
  rethrowing when provider admission (`_enforceCompactionBeforeProvider` /
  `_enforceFinalProviderAdmission`) rejects, mirroring `sendUserMessage`'s
  documented retention contract.

### Why

- A custom `triggerTurn` message sent while a non-auto compaction owned the
  session (extension feedback stage via `beginCompaction`, extension `compact`
  action, manual `/compact`) was parked in the agent-level queues without a
  turn and nothing resumed it afterwards; an admission rejection dropped the
  message entirely because the fire-and-forget extension `sendMessage` action
  swallows the rejection. Hidden goal continuations were the primary victim:
  their single-flight latch clears only on `agent_start`, so the goal silently
  idled at "Pursuing goal (...)" until manual user input.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Both fixes depend on internal compaction lifecycle ownership, agent-level
  queue state, and the private continuation scheduler; no extension hook can
  observe or reschedule them.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` around `compact()` / `applyCompaction()` / the
  extension `compact` action finally blocks, `sendCustomMessage()`'s
  triggerTurn branch, and `_scheduleContinuationAfterCurrentEvent()`.

## Hint-aware 429 retry tier routing (2026-08-03)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts` retry orchestration classifies 429-class errors into three tiers using the structured
  hint from `packages/ai`: no-hint 429 falls back immediately with zero same-model retries; tier 1 (hint ≤
  `hintedWaitCapMs`, default 300 000 ms) performs in-turn half/full probes via `nextInTurnDelayMs` with
  cumulative-cap demotion; tier 2 (`hintedWaitCapMs` < hint < `probeBackMaxMs`) falls back and schedules
  at most two `ProbeBackScheduler` probes at half/deadline, clearing cooldown on success so
  `maybeRestorePrimary` reverts next turn; tier 3 (hint ≥ `probeBackMaxMs`) falls back only with a
  remaining-hint cooldown.
- `retry-fallback/probe-scheduler.ts` (new) owns the tier 2 probe schedule. `retry-fallback/controller.ts`
  and `retry-fallback/cooldown.ts` carry the tier decision and cooldown state.
  `retry-fallback/settings.ts` adds `resolveHintPolicySettings` with `hintedWaitCapMs` and `probeBackMaxMs`
  (defaults 300 000 / 3 600 000 ms).
- New session events `retry_probe_scheduled` and `retry_probe_result` surface probe lifecycle to the client.
- `retry-fallback-long-delay.test.ts` has two intentionally updated assertions: tier routing replaces the
  legacy over-budget gate for 429-class errors, so the expected retry/fallback behavior changes accordingly.

### Why

- A blind exponential backoff on 429 wastes a turn when the provider says “retry now,” and retries
  immediately when the provider says “wait an hour.” Structured hints let the agent respect the provider's
  guidance instead of guessing.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The tier decision must intercept the retry sleep and fallback switch inside agent-session's orchestration
  loop, between the provider error and the retry/fallback decision. The extension API exposes no hook at that
  point — extensions see only post-decision error strings.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts` retry orchestration (approximately lines 5380–5705).
- MEDIUM: `retry-fallback/*` (controller, cooldown, settings, probe-scheduler).
- LOW: `settings-manager.ts` for the new `hintedWaitCapMs` / `probeBackMaxMs` settings.

## Backfill: eval bridge deadlock prevention (2026-08-01)

### What changed

- Eval bridge requests no longer deadlock the session when completion and bridge delivery race.

### Why

- A blocked bridge stalls the entire agent turn and leaves no safe continuation path.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The fix depends on internal agent-session bridge ordering and completion ownership.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- Agent-session eval bridge handlers, pending request state, and completion/error cleanup.

## Deduplicate high-reasoning warnings per session model (2026-07-31)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts` now remembers every sensitive provider/model identity that
  already displayed the high-reasoning warning during the current session.
- Moving between `xhigh`, `max`, lower reasoning levels, or another model no
  longer re-arms the warning for an identity the user already saw.
- A different sensitive provider/model identity still receives its own first
  warning.

### Why

- The previous single last-key value was cleared whenever the active state was
  not warnable and included the reasoning level in its key. Cycling reasoning
  levels or switching away and back therefore appended the same large warning
  box repeatedly.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `agent-session.ts` warning-dedup state and
  `_emitHighReasoningWarningIfNeeded()`.

## Preserve the user's reasoning preference across model switches (2026-07-31)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts`: manual model selection and favorite-model cycling now
  apply model-specific overrides and capability clamps as session-effective
  levels without replacing `defaultThinkingLevel`.
- Model switches without an explicit favorite tier restore the remembered
  `defaultThinkingLevel` before clamping it to the selected model.

### Why

- Switching from a max-capable model to a basic reasoning model persisted the
  clamped `high` tier, so switching back no longer restored the user's last
  selected `max` tier. Explicit favorite tiers could likewise replace the
  global preference even though they are model-specific overrides.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `agent-session.ts` around `_switchActiveModel()`,
  `_cycleFavoriteModel()`, and `_getThinkingLevelForModelSwitch()`.

## Thinking-level tier detection delegates to packages/ai (2026-07-30)

### What changed

- `thinking-levels.ts` no longer re-implements the `xhigh` / `max` model-id lists. `supportsXhigh`,
  `supportsMax`, and `getSupportedThinkingLevels` now wrap the canonical `@earendil-works/pi-ai` helpers
  and only keep the coding-agent's `ThinkingLevel` vocabulary plus the non-empty `["off"]` fallback.
- The local `ModelWithThinkingLevelMap` cast is gone: `Model.thinkingLevelMap` is already part of the
  public `pi-ai` model type.

### Why

- Tier rules belong to `packages/ai`; delegating removes the coding-agent's duplicate model-id lists and
  precedence logic so future capability changes have one implementation. Generated catalog models retain
  their explicit maps, so behavior for real catalog models is intentionally unchanged.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Tier detection feeds session thinking-level clamping and the model/RPC surfaces inside core; it is not
  reachable from an extension.

## Codex fast-variant service-tier metadata lookup (2026-07-29)

### What changed

- `model-registry.ts` now exposes a selected model's configured `serviceTier`
  synchronously, alongside the existing `getUpstreamModelId()` lookup.
- The builtin `/fast` command uses both values to accept only catalog siblings
  that send the same upstream model with `service_tier: "priority"`.

### Why

- A `-fast` suffix alone is not proof that a model supports priority
  processing. The command must validate the request metadata already resolved
  by the model registry before switching the session.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Compatibility request metadata is composed inside `ModelRuntime`; extensions
  can inspect the registry but could not synchronously read its resolved
  per-model service tier.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the request-metadata accessors in `model-registry.ts`.

## Settings withLock first-write TOCTOU fix (2026-07-29)

### What changed

- `settings-manager.ts` `FileSettingsStorage.withLock`: when the settings file does not exist yet, the merge callback used to run with no lock held and the write-time lock then overwrote whatever a concurrent process had created. The write path now re-checks existence after acquiring the lock and re-runs the merge callback against the winner's content before writing. The existing-file path additionally re-verifies existence after the lock before reading.
- Pure read paths are unchanged: a read on a missing file still creates no directory and no lock artifacts, so loading settings in an arbitrary cwd still cannot spray `.senpi/` directories.

### Why

- Two processes racing the first write of a fresh `settings.json` silently lost one side's fields (`existsSync` gated the lock, so the merge ran unlocked). Deterministic regression: `test/settings-storage-lock.test.ts` injects a concurrent first-write at lock acquisition and asserts the merge preserves it.

## Nearest-parent project settings discovery (2026-07-28)

### What changed

- `settings-manager.ts`: project settings now resolve from the nearest ancestor containing a real `.senpi` directory, rather than only from the exact cwd. If none exists, the legacy `<cwd>/.senpi/settings.json` path remains the write/read target.
- Global settings remain loaded before project settings, so project values continue to override the selected agent-directory settings layer.

### Why

- Invoking senpi below a project root silently skipped that root's `.senpi/settings.json`.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `getSettingsPath()` in `settings-manager.ts`.

## messages.ts keep-latest exclusion for goal-continuation (2026-07-29)

### What changed

- `messages.ts` now excludes consumed `goal-continuation` custom messages by position instead of by type: every
  `role === "custom" && customType === GOAL_CONTINUATION_MESSAGE_TYPE` entry is dropped except the last one.
  The same keep-latest rule is applied in both `filterContextExcludedMessages` and `convertToLlm`, so token estimation
  and provider payload assembly stay in sync.
- `isContextExcludedCustomMessage` remains `false` for this custom type; the live triggering message still needs to be
  visible to per-entry consumers such as compaction and branch summarization.

### Why

- Goal continuation messages accumulate across long sessions, and stale consumed entries must stay out of the next
  provider request without hiding the active trigger or letting the estimator disagree with the payload.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW in `messages.ts` around the shared keep-latest helper, `filterContextExcludedMessages`, and `convertToLlm`.
- NONE in the per-entry custom-message predicate semantics.

## AgentEndEvent.willRetry extension event field (2026-07-29)

### What changed

- `extensions/types.ts` now exposes an optional `willRetry?: boolean` on `AgentEndEvent`, mirroring the agent-session
  end event so builtin extensions can tell a terminal provider error from a retryable one.
- The field is additive only; existing extension consumers that ignore it continue to behave the same.

### Why

- The goal builtin needs to block on terminal provider errors only after retries are exhausted. Without the retry
  signal, a terminal error could be misclassified while a fallback retry was still in flight.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW in `extensions/types.ts` and the runner plumbing that forwards agent-session end events to builtin extensions.

## claude-agent-sdk provider with native multi-account OAuth (2026-07-27)

### What changed

- New builtin extension `core/extensions/builtin/claude-agent-sdk/`: routes LLM calls through the
  official Claude Agent SDK (spawns the real Claude Code engine) while senpi executes all tools
  (Claude Code tool use is denied; custom tools are exposed in-process as `mcp__custom-tools__*`).
- Auth: `/login claude-agent-sdk` runs the existing Anthropic PKCE flow and stores multi-account
  slots inside the provider credential (top-level fields are non-expiring sentinels; real refresh is
  per-slot under the store lock). Import of an existing `anthropic` OAuth credential and
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN(_N)` env accounts supported.
- HRW session affinity (rendezvous hashing) pins each session to one account to preserve prompt
  cache; mandatory failover on rate_limit/overloaded/auth errors only, stream-safe (no transparent
  retry after the first visible delta) with an AgentSession `senpi:no-turn-retry:` marker suppressing
  whole-turn replay of post-delta failures.
- Surfaces: `/claude-account` command, `--claude-account` flag, RPC `get_provider_accounts` /
  `account_pin` / `account_remove` plus `auth_accounts_changed` / `account_failover` events, and
  actionable auth guidance. `AuthStorage` learned to enumerate extension-registered OAuth providers
  (`registerOAuthProvider` bridge), synced from `ModelRuntime.registerProvider`.
- Dependency: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` pinned `0.3.220`; `@anthropic-ai/sdk` stays `0.91.1`
  via a root override (the `>=0.93.0` peer range breaks the browser build through node-builtin
  imports in new credential modules).

## Session-title generation retry + humanized provider errors (2026-07-27)

### What changed

- `session-title-generator.ts`: `generateSessionTitle()` accepts an optional `retry: RetryPolicy` and wraps the
  title call in `retryAssistantCall`, mirroring `completeSummarization()`. A transient provider error (e.g. an
  Anthropic 529 `overloaded_error` stream event) no longer fails title generation on the first attempt. Final
  failures throw `humanizeProviderError(...)` output — a short human-readable line such as
  `Overloaded (overloaded_error, request req_...)` — instead of the raw provider JSON body.
- `session-title-generator.ts`: new `sessionTitleRetryPolicy()` narrows the user's `settings.retry` for this
  cosmetic background call — `enabled` is preserved, `maxRetries` capped at 1 and `baseDelayMs` at 2000ms, and a
  smaller configured budget is never inflated. The full agent-turn budget would keep hitting an already-overloaded
  provider for ~14s while the user's real turn competes for the same capacity; a title that still fails is
  regenerated at the next turn end anyway.
- `agent-session.ts`: `_generateSessionTitle()` passes `sessionTitleRetryPolicy(settingsManager.getRetrySettings())`.
  The runtime-emitted extension-error sites now use the shared `RUNTIME_EXTENSION_PATH` sentinel constant.

### Why

- A single transient 529 during background title generation surfaced as `Extension "<runtime>" error: {raw json}`
  in the TUI and left the session untitled until the next turn end.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `session-title-generator.ts` around `generateSessionTitle()`.
- LOW: `agent-session.ts` `_generateSessionTitle()` and the `emitError` call sites.

## Composable leading skill commands (2026-07-26)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts`: `/skill:<name>` now accepts a leading whitespace-separated run of loaded skills, expanding each unique skill in written order before appending the remaining prompt text. Repeated skills expand only once, unknown skills stop the run and remain literal, and slash text outside that leading run is never interpreted as a skill command.
- Explicit expansion is capped at `MAX_SKILL_EXPANSIONS_PER_PROMPT` (5). Commands beyond the cap remain literal and emit an existing `skill_expansion` error-channel notification, preventing a composed prompt from growing context without bound.
- The shared expansion seam is called by `prompt()`, `steer()`, and `followUp()`, so queued and non-TUI/RPC prompt paths receive identical behavior.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

Skill commands are resource-loader entries rather than extension commands, and their substitution happens in the private `AgentSession` prompt and queue boundary before the outbound user message is assembled.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `agent-session.ts` `_expandSkillCommand()` if upstream revises skill-command parsing.

## Provider-bound inline image budget (2026-07-26)

### What changed

- `messages.ts`: added a transport-only 24 MiB inline image budget. Provider-bound conversion keeps the newest image
  block, counts it against the budget, and replaces images older than the hard recency cutoff with a re-read
  placeholder while preserving all text and leaving the persisted session untouched.
- `sdk.ts`: routes the main agent loop through the shared transport conversion while preserving the dynamic
  `images.blockImages` kill switch and its existing placeholder/deduplication behavior.
- `test/suite/harness.ts`: uses the same transport conversion and accepts a small injectable image budget for
  deterministic first-request integration coverage.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Inline images must be bounded after session messages are converted but before every main-loop provider request,
  including resumed sessions and provider fallbacks. That conversion boundary is owned by the core Agent wiring.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `sdk.ts` around the Agent `convertToLlm` wiring.
- LOW: the transport helpers at the end of `messages.ts` and the Agent construction in `test/suite/harness.ts`.

## Thinking-level tier detection for Claude 5 families and GPT-5.6 (2026-07-25)

### What changed

- `src/core/thinking-levels.ts`: `supportsXhigh` now recognizes `gpt-5.6`, `opus-5`, `sonnet-5` and
  `fable-5`; `supportsMax` recognizes `opus-5`, `sonnet-5` and `fable-5`. These lists are the fallback
  for models with no `thinkingLevelMap` (custom `models.json` entries and third-party gateways), so
  those models previously could not reach the `xhigh` / `max` tiers in the level cycler even though
  their provider accepts them. Bundled catalog models are unaffected because an explicit map wins.
- This file is the coding-agent copy of the tier predicates; `packages/ai/src/models.ts` owns the
  `pi-ai` copy and was updated in lockstep.

### Why

- `off` also became selectable for Claude Fable 5 in this change set: `packages/ai` now encodes
  "cannot send `thinking.type: disabled`" as a compat fact rather than `thinkingLevelMap.off: null`,
  and the Messages provider pins the cheapest effort for an off turn. The selector needed no change
  for that - removing the `null` was enough.

## Session-owned compaction lifecycle (2026-07-23)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts` now holds a monotonic compaction lifecycle coordinator that snapshots the active model and
  controller at operation start, rejects stale completion/feedback, and retains the terminal result until another
  operation begins. Feedback-only aborts publish one terminal event, and accepted completions publish their terminal
  event before `session_compact` handlers can begin a fresh operation.
- Owned automatic compaction attempts publish balanced start/end events when execution cannot begin. Ownership is
  rechecked after start: a synchronous listener that supersedes the controller with a new operation silences the stale
  terminal event (the new owner publishes its own lifecycle), while a listener that aborts the same controller still
  receives an `aborted` terminal event so UI state opened on `compaction_start` is always closed.
- Durable append now rejects a generation whose message revision or agent-message snapshot changed during preparation
  or summary generation (`stale-revision`), preserving intervening context without duplicate replay.
- Required compaction uses one provider-admission gate for normal prompts, extension-triggered turns, and every next
  turn. Provider-confirmed overflow remains fail-closed even when the local token estimate is below the configured
  threshold; `agent_end` synchronously transfers both silent-overflow and threshold-compaction continuation ownership
  to `AgentSession` before agent-core can drain native queues, and failed recovery restores the overflow context so
  later prompts cannot bypass the same requirement.
- Next-turn snapshots reapply the live active tools and effective per-run system prompt after asynchronous preparation,
  so a tool removed during the turn is neither advertised nor executable by the following provider request.
- Required ownership now suppresses only agent-core's post-`agent_end` queue drain, not the run abort signal. Deferred
  extension dispatch retains the real source signal, so compaction ownership does not masquerade as user cancellation.
- Retry and fallback admission resolve required compaction first; rejected recovery retains native queues without
  dispatching a provider retry. Active-tool changes advance the context revision and abort active core compaction so
  summaries prepared against a prior tool set cannot apply.
- Fallback apply/revert transitions emit typed model-selection events, rebuild model-scoped tools and prompts, abort
  compaction prepared for the prior model, and re-run required compaction against the selected model's context window
  before retrying.
- Message objects are associated with their persisted session-entry order. Compaction-boundary checks use that order
  (and treat pending `message_end` persistence as post-boundary) instead of relying only on payload timestamps.
- Session reload materialization restores those message-to-entry associations, so older payload timestamps cannot
  bypass post-compaction admission after reopening a session.
- When a late queue triggers compaction after a host `prepareNextTurnWithContext` callback, the callback is replayed
  once against the compacted context so its message filtering/injection contract reaches the provider request.
- Every compaction execution receives its route-owned controller explicitly. Auto compaction cannot promote unrelated
  extension feedback, and superseded feedback controller references are released even when their stale terminal
  callback never arrives.
- Post-retry and post-compaction usage exemptions suppress only stale threshold accounting. Provider-confirmed
  overflow always retains queue ownership and runs fail-closed recovery.
- Extension-originated provider turns now wait behind active session work and manual compaction. `clearQueue()` clears
  both native and post-compaction deferred ownership layers, preventing canceled steer/follow-up input from resurfacing.
- Provider admission is checked again after assembling `nextTurn` and `before_agent_start` custom messages. Rejected
  compaction restores one-shot additions transactionally; accepted compaction rebuilds and rechecks the final visible
  request before the provider is called.
- Request-local context provenance is attached non-enumerably to message identities and removed from persisted/session
  JSON. Remote replay uses it to prove the exact checkpoint boundary after filtering, injection, or reordering.
- Trigger-turn custom messages serialize behind manual/extension compaction before they are appended or sent.
  Scheduled continuation revalidates the canonical context against any model selected by `session_compact`, retaining
  queues when the smaller model requires rejected re-compaction.
- Manual and extension compaction claim a synchronous pending-admission barrier before their first await, closing the
  same-tick window where a trigger-turn custom message could overtake startup. Retry continuation failures that occur
  before provider dispatch now settle retry/idle state and retain queues instead of hanging the session.
- Fire-and-forget `session_start` messages defer past replacement-session work without being discarded as stale.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Model selection, durable session append, provider-overflow recovery, controller ownership, and prompt admission are
  private `AgentSession` lifecycle boundaries.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts` compaction execution, pre-prompt recovery, abort handling, and extension context bindings.

## Streaming steer/followUp submissions bypass the session-work barrier (2026-07-21)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts` (`prompt()`): a submission with a `streamingBehavior` while a run is active and not
  compacting now queues immediately instead of awaiting `_waitForSettledSessionWork()`. Scheduled
  queued-message continuations (goal chains, queued follow-ups) hold the `SessionWorkBarrier` for the
  entire remaining run, so the old gate trapped typed input inside `prompt()` — invisible, unqueued, and
  undelivered — until the whole chain settled or the user pressed Esc.
- If the run ends while the bypassed input is being expanded, `prompt()` re-serializes with remaining
  session work and re-queues when a scheduled continuation started a new run in the meantime.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- The trap sits between core-owned `prompt()` serialization and the core continuation scheduler; both are
  private `AgentSession` lifecycle boundaries.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` `prompt()` entry serialization and the streaming queue dispatch branch.

## Memoized materialized session views (2026-07-21)

### What changed

- `session-manager.ts`: added a monotonic `mutationCount` bumped by every mutator (`_appendEntry`, `branch()`,
  `resetLeaf()`, `setSessionFile`, `newSession`, `createBranchedSession`). `getEntries()` is memoized on
  `mutationCount`, no-arg `getBranch()` on `(leafId, mutationCount)` (explicit `fromId` bypasses), and
  `getSessionName()` is O(1) via a cached value maintained on `appendSessionInfo`/`_buildIndex` (empty name still
  clears the title). `getEntries()` now returns a shared cached array callers must not mutate.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- The mutation surface and resident-store materialization are private to `SessionManager`; external wrappers cannot
  observe every invalidation point.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: private fields and the listed getters; upstream rarely touches `SessionManager` internals.

## Smooth streaming settings (2026-07-20)

### What changed

- `settings-manager.ts`: added persisted `smoothStreaming` and `smoothStreamingFps` settings. Smoothing defaults on,
  FPS defaults to 60, and reads clamp the configured value to 30–120.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- The built-in interactive renderer must read the setting before extensions load and while it owns an active stream.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `Settings` fields and accessors near the existing thinking-visibility setting.

## "video" input modality plumbed through provider composition (2026-07-17)

### What changed

- `provider-composer.ts`: model `input` arrays (config input, models.json override, custom model definition)
  widened to `("text" | "image" | "video")[]`, tracking the pi-ai `Model.input` union. Enables the
  kimi-coding `k3` video input capability and models.json overrides declaring video.
- `remote-catalog-provider.ts`: `mergeModels` now unions `input` modalities (canonical text/image/video
  order) when a pi.dev overlay entry replaces a builtin model. The overlay refreshes costs/limits but a
  stale remote entry must not silently drop a fork-declared capability — the cached kimi-coding `k3`
  entry in `models-store.json` otherwise strips `"video"` and deactivates the `read_video` tool.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- The modality union is a core type shared with pi-ai; extensions consume it but cannot widen it.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `provider-composer.ts` model field lists.

## Model-switch atomicity: live prompt options and api-change gate (2026-07-19)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_modelSelectionChangesContext` now also fires on `api`
  changes with identical provider, id, and context window, so wire-protocol-only model
  changes trigger full toolset/prompt synchronization.
- `src/core/extensions/runner.ts`: `emitModelSelect` re-reads live `systemPromptOptions`
  per handler so an earlier handler that swaps the active toolset (gpt-apply-patch) lets
  later handlers (prompt-preset) rebuild the system prompt from the post-swap tools in
  the same emission.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- The stale-snapshot defect lives in the core emission path; extensions only consume the
  combined `model_select` result.

## Composed providers engage text tool-call compatibility middleware (2026-07-17)

### What changed

- `provider-composer.ts`: composed provider `stream()` and `streamSimple()` now apply the text tool-call middleware when a model has `compat.toolCallFormat` and active tools. Custom `models.json` providers previously dispatched directly to their base or API provider, silently bypassing this compatibility behavior.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- Provider composition owns the final base-provider/API-provider stream dispatch before extensions receive model output, so extensions cannot insert the required context transformation and streaming parser on both paths.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `provider-composer.ts` shared `streamWith()` dispatch and its `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` imports.

## AnthropicMessagesCompat.supportsWebSearch in models.json schema (2026-07-16)

### What changed

- `model-config.ts` (`AnthropicMessagesCompatSchema`): added optional boolean `supportsWebSearch`, mirroring
  `supportsWebSearchPreview` in `OpenAIResponsesCompatSchema`. This is the models.json opt-in for
  Anthropic-compatible endpoints that genuinely support server-side web search (see `packages/ai/src/changes.md`
  2026-07-16); without the schema entry the flag would fail models.json validation.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone

- models.json validation happens in core `model-config.ts` before any extension sees the model entry.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `model-config.ts` compat schemas if upstream adds more compat flags.

## Skill-loading trigger reframed with cost asymmetry (2026-07-16)

### What changed

- `skills.ts` (`formatSkillsForPrompt`): the load trigger changed from "when the task matches its description" to "whenever its description even loosely matches the task - loading an irrelevant skill costs little; missing a relevant one degrades the work" (ported from omo Hephaestus). `skills.test.ts` pins "even loosely matches".

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- `formatSkillsForPrompt` is core-owned and rendered into every system prompt. Strict-match framing under-loads skills on compression-biased models (GPT-5.6); stating the cost asymmetry is the decision-rule form the 5.6 guide prescribes for judgment calls.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `skills.ts` intro lines if upstream rewords the skills preamble.

## Release accepted auto-compaction ownership before recovery (2026-07-13)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts`: accepted auto-compaction now releases only its own abort-controller identity before awaiting the recovery continuation, while the session-work barrier remains active until recovery settles.
- Final cleanup is identity-guarded so an older compaction cannot clear a newer controller installed during recovery.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Interactive input classification reads core-owned `AgentSession.isCompacting`, and fresh-prompt serialization depends on the private session-work barrier. Extensions cannot split those two lifecycle boundaries safely.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` around `_runAutoCompaction()` accepted-result handling and final controller cleanup.

## Post-compaction continuation deadlock fix (2026-07-12)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts`: deferred post-compaction and queued-message continuations until the current serialized
  `agent_end` event promise resolves, while registering the detached continuation in `SessionWorkBarrier`.
- Overflow retry, threshold/pending-message delivery, and normal queued `agent_end` continuation use the same scheduler.

### Why

- Awaiting `agent.continue()` inside the active `agent_end` queue item deadlocked tool-bearing continuations because
  pre-tool hooks wait for the current agent-event queue to finish persisting.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- `AgentSession` owns the event queue, tool-hook barrier, settlement state, and continuation launch boundary.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` around `agent_end` queued continuation handling and `_runAutoCompaction()` recovery.
- LOW: `_continueAgentAfterCurrentRun()` and the session-work barrier integration.

## Preserve builtin extensions after project trust resolution (2026-07-12)

### What changed

- `resource-loader.ts`: project-trust reloads now carry forward only preloaded factory-origin extensions - builtins, bundled codemode package entries, and inline factories - ahead of file-based extensions.
- Shadowed or disabled file extensions from the pre-trust pass remain excluded from the trusted final set instead of being restored by the factory carry-over.
- Added regression coverage that verifies trusted reloads preserve plain-reload membership and builtin-first order, including `todowrite`, codemode's `eval` tool, and a shadowed `pi-todotools` package.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Project trust uses a core-owned two-phase resource load. Only the resource loader can retain the factory instances and side effects from the untrusted bootstrap pass while rebuilding the final trusted extension order.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `resource-loader.ts` around trusted final extension-set composition.
## Upstream model context overflow recovery (2026-07-08)

### What changed

- `model-registry.ts`: exposed configured `upstreamModelId` metadata synchronously so session-control code can compare selected aliases with provider-reported wire model ids without resolving credentials.
- `agent-session.ts`: overflow recovery now treats a context-window error from the configured upstream model id as the same current-model source, preserving the existing stale/unrelated model guard.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Provider context-overflow recovery happens inside the core session compaction gate before extensions can safely decide whether to retry the active turn.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` around `_checkCompaction()` overflow eligibility.
- LOW: `model-registry.ts` around model request metadata accessors.

## Bundled codemode extension loading (2026-07-06)

### What changed

- `resource-loader.ts`: added `codemode` as a builtin-adjacent bundled extension loaded from the `@code-yeongyu/senpi-codemode` package manifest.
- The bundled extension is enabled by default, respects `enabledBuiltinExtensions` and `disabledBuiltinExtensions`, is unaffected by `--no-extensions`, and is still removable from the active tool set through `--exclude-tools eval`.
- Resolution failures, including compiled Bun binary package-resolution gaps, are reported as extension diagnostics and startup continues without `eval`.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- The extension package is shipped with the CLI and must be active before user extension discovery and project-trust resolution. User-installed extension paths cannot model that trusted default-on load order.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `resource-loader.ts` around builtin extension loading, package shadowing, and active builtin id filtering.

## executeTool active-tool bridge (2026-07-06)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts`: added the core implementation for `pi.executeTool()`, including active-tool resolution, shared agent-loop argument preflight, synthetic `codemode-*` tool call ids, hook block handling, and post-result rewrites.
- Extracted the existing `beforeToolCall` and `afterToolCall` hook bodies into shared helpers used by both normal agent-loop dispatch and `executeTool()`.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Extensions can observe and register tools, but only the session owns the active wrapped tool instances, the agent-event queue, and the hook/permission pipeline needed to execute subcalls with the same semantics as model tool calls.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts` around `_installAgentToolHooks()`, `getActiveToolNames()`, and extension `bindCore()` wiring.

## Neo auth RPC core surface (2026-07-06)

### What changed

- `auth-providers.ts` (fork-only): shared auth-provider list module — the single source of truth across the classic
  TUI `/login` flow and the RPC auth commands.
- `agent-session.ts`: emits `auth_login_url` / `auth_login_end` as `AgentSessionEvent`s so interactive OAuth
  round-trips can complete out-of-band of a single RPC request; reuses `AuthStorage.login` callbacks unchanged.

### Why

- The neo Go TUI logs in over RPC (see `modes/rpc/changes.md`); login completion cannot fit inside the 30s RPC
  request timeout, so the terminal result must arrive as session events.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Auth storage, login callbacks, and session event emission are core session services.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `agent-session.ts` around session event union and emission sites.
- LOW: `auth-providers.ts` (fork-only file).

## Provider stream idle timeout enabled by default (2026-07-06)

### What changed

- `sdk.ts`: the agent's stream idle timeout now defaults to `httpIdleTimeoutMs` (300s default) instead of being off
  unless `retry.provider.timeoutMs` was set.
- `settings-manager.ts`: `httpIdleTimeoutMs` participates in the default resolution; `0` disables, and
  `retry.provider.timeoutMs` still overrides.

### Why

- Sessions went stale forever when the network dropped and reconnected mid-stream: the dead connection never errors.
  Node runs were eventually rescued by the undici dispatcher body timeout, but the Bun binary has no such protection
  and hung indefinitely. With the guard on by default, a silently dead connection fails with a retryable idle-timeout
  error and auto-retry recovers the turn (abort-side fix in `packages/agent/src/changes.md` 2026-07-06).

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Stream option defaults are resolved in core SDK/settings plumbing before extensions see a request.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `sdk.ts` stream-option assembly; `settings-manager.ts` retry/timeout resolution.

## External stdout/stderr guards while a TUI owns the terminal (2026-07-04)

### What changed

- `hidden-stdout-log.ts` (fork-only): hidden external stdout writes are redacted and appended to the debug log.
- `output-guard.ts` / `sensitive-output.ts`: stderr writes are likewise hidden and redacted while a TUI owns the
  terminal, matching the interactive stderr guard.
- Wiring: interactive mode, startup dialogs, and the config selector (see `modes/interactive/changes.md` and
  `cli/changes.md`); the TUI-side hook is `ProcessTerminal.onExternalStdoutWrite` (`packages/tui/src/changes.md`
  2026-07-04).

### Why

- A stray `console.log` from a library or extension corrupted the trust dialog and permanently desynchronized
  differential rendering.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Redaction and debug-log routing for hidden writes are core services shared by every TUI surface.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `hidden-stdout-log.ts`, `output-guard.ts`, `sensitive-output.ts` (fork-heavy files).

## Persist truncated bash output contents (2026-07-03)

### What changed

- `bash-executor.ts`: when bash output is truncated for the model context, the truncated contents are still persisted
  so the session record keeps the full output.

### Why

- Truncation previously dropped the overflow entirely; transcripts and session replays lost output that the user's
  terminal had shown.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Output truncation happens inside the built-in bash executor before tool results reach extension hooks.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `bash-executor.ts` truncation/persistence path.

## Await available-model lookups (2026-07-03)

### What changed

- `model-resolver.ts`: available-model lookups are properly awaited instead of racing an unresolved promise.

### Why

- The fork's model-resolution flow could observe an empty model list mid-startup.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Startup model resolution runs before extensions load.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `model-resolver.ts` async lookup call sites.

## App-server app-mode plumbing (2026-07-02)

### What changed

- `project-trust.ts`: `AppMode` gained `"app-server"` so project-trust resolution covers the fork's app-server mode
  (mode itself lives in `modes/app-server/`, dispatch in `src/changes.md` 2026-07-02).

### Why

- App-server sessions must honor the same project-trust gating as interactive/rpc modes.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Trust gating is evaluated in core before a mode starts.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `project-trust.ts` `AppMode` union.

## Upstream session, auth, and model-resolution sync (2026-07-02)

### What changed

- `auth-storage.ts`: accepted upstream persistence-failure surfacing so `/login` does not report success when `auth.json`
  could not be saved.
- `agent-session.ts`: accepted upstream split-turn serialization and kept fork prompt/compaction settlement behavior.
- `session-manager.ts`: accepted upstream context-building helper splits while preserving fork compaction detail propagation
  through `createCompactionSummaryMessage(entry.details)`.
- `model-resolver.ts`: accepted upstream structured model-resolution diagnostics and public helper behavior while
  preserving the fork's optional warning callback.

### Why

- These upstream fixes improve observable login errors, prevent overlapping summary generations, and expose consistent
  model diagnostics without dropping fork-only compaction metadata or warning behavior.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Auth persistence, session context reconstruction, prompt/compaction scheduling, and model scope resolution are core
  session services that run before extensions can replace them.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts` around prompt execution, compaction settlement, and split-turn continuation.
- MEDIUM: `session-manager.ts` around `sessionEntryToContextMessages()` and compaction-entry reconstruction.
- MEDIUM: `model-resolver.ts` around `resolveModelScope()` and diagnostics helpers.
- LOW: `auth-storage.ts` around save failure propagation.

## Resident session payload retention (2026-06-08)

### What changed

- `src/core/session-manager.ts`: large in-memory session strings are retained through a resident store while public
  readers, LLM context construction, branching, forking, and JSONL persistence materialize the original content.
- `src/core/session-resident-store.ts`: centralizes resident string references and store statistics for session payloads.

### Why

- Long sessions can retain repeated large message payloads in every session tree/index view. Keeping large resident
  strings behind lightweight refs lowers steady-state session memory pressure without changing persisted sessions.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `SessionManager` append, reload, branch, and persistence paths.
- LOW: tests under `test/session-manager/` that assert exact in-memory entry identity.

## Compaction prompt settlement barrier (2026-05-28)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: normal user prompts now wait for pending session event processing and in-flight
  compaction work before starting a fresh provider request.
- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: overflow retry and user-visible queued follow-up/steering recovery now await the
  post-compaction continuation instead of scheduling an unobserved delayed `continue()`.
- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: agent-level custom-only queues also use the awaited post-compaction continuation path.
- `src/core/session-work-barrier.ts`: centralizes nested session-work barriers used by compaction settlement.

### Why

- `Agent` can become idle before `AgentSession` finishes `agent_end` compaction work. A prompt submitted in that window
  could race ahead of the compaction boundary or overflow recovery, making queued messages appear out of order or miss the
  compacted context.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Extensions can provide compaction results, but only `AgentSession` can serialize fresh prompts against session event
  processing, compaction mutation, and retry/queue continuation.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `AgentSession.prompt()` around the pre-prompt settlement and post-prompt wait.
- MEDIUM: `_executeCompaction()` and `_runAutoCompaction()` around compaction lifecycle and continuation handling.

## Compaction cancellation across abort and model changes (2026-05-23)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: `abort()` and `dispose()` now cancel in-flight manual/auto compaction and branch
  summarization controllers along with retry/agent cleanup.
- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: `setModel()` and favorite model cycling invalidate compaction state and bump the
  message revision whenever the selected model identity or context window changes.
- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: `model_select` now emits for same provider/model-id selections that change the effective
  context window, so extensions can drop stale model-bound work.

### Why

- An aborted over-context turn could leave a compaction request alive. If the user then switched to a larger-context
  model, stale compaction could finish beside the next normal assistant response and surface duplicate Working/status
  state.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Extensions can observe model and compaction events, but the session owns the abort controllers and the monotonic
  message revision that guards precomputed compaction snapshots.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `AgentSession.abort()`, `setModel()`, and `_cycleFavoriteModel()` lifecycle paths.
- LOW: `AgentSession.dispose()` cleanup path and `_emitModelSelect()` early-return logic.

## Tool hook lifecycle status events (2026-05-19)

### What changed

- `src/core/extensions/runner.ts`: `tool_call` and `tool_result` handlers now emit internal start/end lifecycle
  observations with `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` labels, bounded status messages, elapsed-time anchors, and completed,
  blocked, or failed end statuses.
- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: the session relays those internal observations to mode listeners as
  `tool_hook_status` events without exposing a new extension author API.

### Why

- The interactive TUI needs to show when extension hook work is happening, including permission-rule matching and
  post-tool result processing, instead of leaving users with only a generic Working indicator.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Extensions can show their own UI, but only the runner knows when each individual hook handler starts, ends, blocks, or
  fails. The session must relay that host-owned lifecycle to the TUI.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `extensions/runner.ts` around `emitToolCall()` and `emitToolResult()`.
- LOW: `agent-session.ts` around `_applyExtensionBindings()` and `AgentSessionEvent`.

## User abort prompt settlement barrier (2026-05-17)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: `abort()` now creates a shared user-abort settlement promise before waiting for the
  active agent run to become idle.
- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: `prompt()` waits for that user-abort promise before classifying submitted input as
  streaming steering/follow-up or a normal fresh prompt.

### Why

- Pressing Esc while a tool call was active started abort asynchronously. A message submitted before the old run settled
  still saw `isStreaming === true`, so it was queued into the aborting run and could remain stuck after abort completed.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- The stale queue classification happens inside `AgentSession.prompt()` before extension commands or input handlers can
  reliably distinguish "streaming" from "currently aborting and about to become idle".

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `AgentSession.prompt()` around the streaming queue branch.
- MEDIUM: `AgentSession.abort()` around agent abort and idle waiting.

## Provider-supplied retry delay handling (2026-05-15)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: auto-retry now uses provider-supplied retry-after hints from assistant error messages when present, while refusing waits above `retry.provider.maxRetryDelayMs`.

### Why

- Rate-limit and overload responses can include an explicit wait period. Ignoring that hint caused senpi to retry too early with the local exponential base delay, often hitting the same provider throttle again.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Retry scheduling is core `AgentSession` lifecycle behavior. Extensions can observe retry events, but they cannot replace the internal abortable sleep or resolve the prompt-level retry promise.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `AgentSession._handleRetryableError()` and retry event emission.

## Avoid duplicate compaction summary message augmentation (2026-05-15)

### What changed

- `messages.ts`: removed the coding-agent-side `CustomAgentMessages.compactionSummary` declaration merge entry.

### Why

- `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core` now declares the shared harness compaction summary message type. Keeping a second
  coding-agent declaration for the same `compactionSummary` slot made `tsgo` reject the package build because the two
  declarations used distinct local interface symbols.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- This is TypeScript declaration metadata for core message unions, evaluated at package build time before extensions run.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `messages.ts` around the `CustomAgentMessages` declaration merge block.

## Compaction detail propagation (2026-05-15)

### What changed

- `messages.ts`: `CompactionSummaryMessage` can now carry opaque `details` from the accepted compaction result.
- `session-manager.ts`: reconstructed compaction summary messages preserve those details when rebuilding context from
  session entries.

### Why

- The OpenAI remote compact API returns provider-native retained input, counts, and route metadata that should remain
  visible after compaction and across context reconstruction without hard-coding provider behavior into core.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Extensions can create the compaction result, but core owns conversion from persisted `compaction` entries into
  `CompactionSummaryMessage` objects.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `messages.ts` around `CompactionSummaryMessage` and `createCompactionSummaryMessage()`.
- LOW: `session-manager.ts` around compaction-entry reconstruction.

## Export tilde paths (2026-05-13)

### What changed

- `src/core/export-html/index.ts` and `src/core/agent-session.ts`: `/export` output paths now expand leading `~` before writing HTML or JSONL exports.

### Why

- A user-facing `/export ~/asdf.jsonl` could create `./~/asdf.jsonl` instead of writing to the home directory.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Export path resolution lives in the core export/session methods before extension command handlers see the final file write.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `export-html/index.ts` and `AgentSession.exportToJsonl()` path handling.

## Overflow alias recovery (2026-05-13)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: context-window overflow errors now trigger overflow compaction with automatic retry when the saved assistant provider differs from the current provider alias but the current context is also at the compaction limit.

### Why

- Imported or resumed sessions can contain OpenAI provider aliases from a previous run. When such a near-limit session overflows, treating the error as threshold compaction leaves the user with an empty error turn and no automatic retry.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Overflow retry policy is core agent-loop recovery behavior; extensions can request compaction but cannot reliably remove the error turn and restart the agent turn.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `AgentSession._checkCompaction()` around overflow-vs-threshold recovery.

## Extension duplicate resource conflict policy (2026-05-12)

### What changed

- `src/core/resource-loader.ts`: Extension paths are deduped by nearest `package.json` package name plus relative extension entry before loading, so the same package installed from both a git package checkout and `~/.senpi/agent/extensions/` loads once without dropping multi-extension packages.
- Builtin extensions now precede disk-loaded extensions in the runtime array, and builtin-vs-external tool/flag name collisions no longer surface as startup errors.
- Extension flag defaults and CLI flag validation now follow that final builtin-first order, so an external duplicate flag cannot override builtin metadata by registering earlier during disk discovery.

### Why

- Users with both installed and manually cloned `code-yeongyu/pi-*` extensions saw noisy duplicate tool/flag conflict errors at startup, even when the duplicates represented the same logical extension or a builtin vendored copy.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Extension factories only run after resource discovery and conflict diagnostics. Deduping package paths and classifying builtin/external conflicts has to happen in the core resource loader before the TUI renders startup diagnostics.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `resource-loader.ts` around extension path assembly, rebuilt flag defaults, and `detectExtensionConflicts()` if upstream changes resource precedence or conflict diagnostics.
- LOW: `agent-session-services.ts` around extension CLI flag validation if upstream changes extension flag parsing.

## models.json per-model prompt preset metadata (2026-05-12)

### What changed

- `src/core/model-registry.ts`: Custom `models.json` model entries and built-in `modelOverrides` can now carry a `promptPreset` string.
- The registry preserves this value as model metadata for extensions instead of interpreting preset names in core code.

### Why

- Provider-specific model IDs can be too new or too aliased for automatic prompt-preset detection. Putting `promptPreset` next to the model definition keeps the routing metadata with the model catalog entry that needs it.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- The prompt-preset extension can consume model metadata, but `models.json` schema validation and model merging live in the core registry. Core needs to preserve the metadata before extensions see the selected model.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `ModelDefinitionSchema`, `ModelOverrideSchema`, and `applyModelOverride()` in `src/core/model-registry.ts` if upstream adds more per-model metadata fields.

## Packaged thinking-tier helpers stay local (2026-05-12)

### What changed
- Added `src/core/thinking-levels.ts` so coding-agent owns the senpi-specific `xhigh` / `max` tier detection and supported-level expansion.
- Updated `src/core/agent-session.ts` and `src/core/sdk.ts` to import these helpers locally instead of from `@earendil-works/pi-ai`.

### Why
- The published `@code-yeongyu/senpi` package currently installs the registry `@earendil-works/pi-ai@0.74.0`, whose public exports do not include the fork-only `supportsXhigh` / `supportsMax` helpers.
- Importing those names directly from `pi-ai` makes packaged senpi fail during module loading before any CLI command runs.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this
- Thinking-tier availability is consumed by core session/model logic (`AgentSession`, SDK helpers) during startup and model switching, before extensions can replace those imports.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- LOW: `agent-session.ts` / `sdk.ts` import blocks and any future upstream move of thinking-level helpers.

## Configured upstream model id and service tier (2026-05-09)

### What changed

- `src/core/model-registry.ts`: Custom `models.json` model entries can now set `upstreamModelId` and per-model `serviceTier`.
- `src/core/sdk.ts`: Provider requests use the configured upstream model id while preserving the configured catalog id for model selection.

### Why

- Users need both a normal catalog entry and a priority catalog entry, such as `gpt-5.5` and `gpt-5.5-fast`, while sending the upstream request as `model: "gpt-5.5"` with `service_tier: "priority"` for only the priority entry.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- The model id is embedded by the provider payload builder before `before_provider_request` hooks run, and `service_tier` is a provider-managed field. The registry has to carry the configured wire id and tier into the stream call before payload construction.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- MEDIUM: `model-registry.ts` schema/request-auth metadata and `sdk.ts` stream option composition.

## Generated default extension fast path (2026-05-08)

### What changed

- `src/core/resource-loader.ts`: Unchanged generated global default extension shims are now recognized by path and exact generated content, then resolved to the known in-process extension factory before the generic jiti loader runs.
- `src/core/resource-loader.ts`: User-edited or replacement files with the same default names still load through the normal extension import path.

### Why

- Clean-profile startup was spending several seconds loading deterministic generated shim files through jiti even though core already knows the matching default extension factories.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Generated default shims are discovered and loaded by core resource bootstrap before extension code can run. Extensions cannot replace the loader's import strategy for their own files.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `resource-loader.ts` around generated global default extension path/content checks and the `loadExtensions()` call.

## Dist-backed default extension shims (2026-05-08)

### What changed

- `src/core/resource-loader.ts`: Default generated global extension shims now point at `dist` files when senpi itself is running from `dist`, even in a linked workspace that also has `src`.

### Why

- Linked CLI startup was re-transpiling default global extension TypeScript files through jiti before the first frame.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Generated default global extension shims are created by core resource loading before extension code runs.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `resource-loader.ts` around `getGlobalDefaultExtensionModulePath()` and default shim generation.

## Model config controls (2026-05-08)

### What changed

- `src/core/model-registry.ts`: `models.json` can disable providers with top-level `disabledProviders` or per-provider `disabled`, filter provider models with `whitelist` / `blacklist`, and replace built-in thinking-level mappings with `thinkingLevelMapMode: "replace"`.
- `src/core/settings-manager.ts` and `src/core/sdk.ts`: added `favoriteModels` settings support and kept `enabledModels` as global model-catalog narrowing.
- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: reload refreshes the model registry, global model narrowing, and favorite models; Ctrl+P cycling only uses the configured favorite models, and available thinking levels honor model-level mapping overrides.

### Why

- The user requested opencode-style provider disable/filtering, favorite-model-only Ctrl+P cycling, and configurable replacement of reasoning variants with reload support.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Model discovery, startup model resolution, persisted settings, and Ctrl+P cycling are core session/model-registry responsibilities. Extensions can add providers or shortcuts, but cannot reliably replace the built-in model registry, default catalog narrowing, or internal cycling semantics before the TUI starts.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- HIGH: `model-registry.ts` schema/loading and model filtering.
- MEDIUM: `sdk.ts` startup model narrowing resolution and `agent-session.ts` reload/cycle paths.

### Migration notes

- `enabledModels` remains readable as global model narrowing, but Ctrl+P favorites are persisted through `favoriteModels`.

## Favorite model filter hardening (2026-05-11)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: favorite models now act as a filter over the current available model list and current global narrowing before being exposed or cycled, so stale cached model objects cannot be selected after a provider/model leaves the registry.
- `src/core/model-resolver.ts`: slash-qualified glob patterns now match canonical `provider/model` ids only, preventing patterns like `openai/*` from also matching raw model ids such as `openai/gpt-*` under another provider.

### Why

- Favorite cycling should only choose models that are still present in the current model catalog. This matches opencode's validity filter behavior and avoids switching to stale favorites after provider/model changes.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Favorite model resolution and Ctrl+P cycling are core `AgentSession` behavior, and glob pattern matching is shared by core startup/reload model resolution before extensions can safely override it.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- `src/core/agent-session.ts` around favorite model getters and `cycleModel()`.
- `src/core/model-resolver.ts` around glob pattern matching in `resolveModelScope()`.

## Favorite model toggle keybinding (2026-05-12)

### What changed

- `src/core/keybindings.ts`: added configurable `app.models.toggleFavorite`, defaulting to `Ctrl+F`, for model selector favorite toggles.

### Why

- Users need the `/model` and `/favorite-models` selectors to select models normally while still being able to toggle favorite status for the highlighted row.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Selector key handling uses the built-in keybinding registry before extension UI code can attach row-local actions, so the built-in selector action needs a first-class keybinding id.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `keybindings.ts` around model selector keybinding definitions.

## Git package dependency repair on update (2026-05-02)

### What changed

- `src/core/package-manager.ts`: `updateGit()` now runs the package dependency install step even when the fetched git target already matches the local checkout.

### Why

- `senpi update` previously returned early for current git packages. If an extension checkout's `node_modules` was damaged or incomplete, the update command reported success but left runtime imports broken.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Git package update and dependency installation are core package-manager responsibilities that run before extension loading.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `DefaultPackageManager.updateGit()` around the post-fetch current-HEAD branch.

## Model Switch System Prompt Change (2026-04-30)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: Applies `model_select` system prompt results immediately, emits `system_prompt_change` only when the active prompt string changes, and returns the change from `setModel()` / `cycleModel()`.
- `src/core/extensions/types.ts`: Added typed `system_prompt_change` event and model-select prompt-change result.
- `src/core/extensions/runner.ts`: Added `emitModelSelect()` to collect prompt-change results from `model_select` handlers.
- `src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts`: Includes the changed prompt name in model-switch status messages and shows standalone prompt-change status for extension-driven switches.
- `src/core/extensions/builtin/prompt-preset/index.ts`: Resolves prompt presets during `model_select` so mid-session model changes update the active prompt immediately.

### Why

- The prompt-preset builtin only changed the effective prompt at the next `before_agent_start`. The user requested mid-session model changes to switch the system prompt immediately, emit a `pi.on` event, and show the TUI notice only when the prompt actually changes.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- The existing extension event runner ignored `model_select` return values and had no core-owned typed event for active system prompt changes. TUI status also needs core session feedback from `setModel()` / `cycleModel()`.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts` around model switching and event emission.
- HIGH: `extensions/types.ts` and `extensions/runner.ts` around model events.
- MEDIUM: `interactive-mode.ts` model status rendering.

### Migration notes

- Keep `system_prompt_change` gated by actual string inequality. Same-preset model switches must not spam the event or TUI.

## Seam 3: Compaction Apply ExtensionContext API (2026-04-27)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: Added in-memory monotonic message revision counter. Added `getMessageRevision()` and `applyCompaction(precomputed, { reason, expectedRevision })` for compare-and-apply speculative compaction.
- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: Extended `_executeCompaction()` to accept a precomputed `CompactionResult`.
- `src/core/extensions/types.ts`: Added `ApplyCompactionOptions`, `ApplyCompactionResult`, `ExtensionContext.getMessageRevision()`, `ExtensionContext.applyCompaction()`.
- `src/core/extensions/runner.ts`: Wired new context actions through `bindCore()` and `createContext()`.
- `src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts`: Added same methods to inline shortcut `ExtensionContext` literal.

### Why

- Speculative/v2 compaction needs a stable compare-and-apply seam: extensions can prepare a compaction summary against revision N and only apply it if no context-affecting message mutation has happened since.
- `getMessageRevision()` is intentionally monotonic and in-memory only; it is a staleness guard, not persisted session data.
- `applyCompaction()` returns explicit `ok`, `stale`, or `rejected` outcomes so extensions can avoid racing the live session.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

Extensions can observe hooks and return summaries during a core-driven compaction, but they cannot append a compaction entry, rebuild agent context, emit core compaction events, or atomically guard against stale session context without a typed core API.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts` around message revision and `applyCompaction()` implementation.
- HIGH: `extensions/types.ts` and `extensions/runner.ts` around `ExtensionContext`/`ExtensionContextActions` definitions.
- MEDIUM: `interactive-mode.ts` shortcut context literals must retain parity with `ExtensionRunner.createContext()`.

### Migration notes

If upstream adds new `ExtensionContext` methods or changes `AgentSession` message mutation logic, preserve the monotonic revision counter and the `applyCompaction()` compare-and-apply semantics. The revision guard must remain in-memory and advance on every context-affecting mutation. Do not let upstream's `ExtensionContext` additions shadow the new methods.

## Seam 3b: Extension Compaction Feedback Scope (2026-05-15)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: Added core-owned begin/end helpers for extension-driven compaction feedback and wired them into `ExtensionContext`.
- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: `applyCompaction()` now reuses an already-open compaction abort controller so an extension can show `compaction_start` before it has a precomputed summary without emitting duplicate start events.
- `src/core/extensions/types.ts` and `src/core/extensions/runner.ts`: Added optional `beginCompaction()` and `endCompaction()` context methods.

### Why

- The fork's speculative/blocking compaction extension can spend time generating or awaiting a summary before `applyCompaction()` is called.
- Without a core-owned feedback scope, the TUI has no compaction loader, Esc cancellation signal, or `isCompacting` input queueing during that wait.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

Extensions can call UI methods, but they cannot set `AgentSession.isCompacting`, own the session abort controller, or emit canonical `compaction_start`/`compaction_end` events without a core context action.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts` around `applyCompaction()`, compaction abort controllers, and extension context binding.
- HIGH: `extensions/types.ts` and `extensions/runner.ts` around `ExtensionContext`/`ExtensionContextActions`.

### Migration notes

If upstream adds a native progress or cancellation API for compaction, map the builtin compaction extension to that API while preserving the invariant that visible feedback starts before extension summary generation begins and ends exactly once.

## Seam 4: Unified Compaction Pipeline (2026-04-27)

### What changed

- `src/core/agent-session.ts`: Consolidated manual, threshold, overflow, pre-prompt, and extension-triggered compaction routes into a single private `_executeCompaction()` pipeline.
- The unified pipeline covers: preparation, extension hook execution (`session_before_compact`), summary generation, pre-append token simulation, session append, context rebuild, and completion event emission (`session_compact`).
- Route-specific metadata (reason, custom instructions, thinking/max-token behavior), error handling, retry handling, token estimation before append, and abort handling now flow through one seam.

### Why

- The user identified 9 route inconsistencies caused by duplicated compaction code paths across manual `/compact`, threshold-triggered, overflow-recovery, pre-prompt, and extension-triggered compaction.
- Without unification, each route handled metadata, error recovery, token estimation, and event emission differently, causing observable behavioral differences for extensions consuming compaction events.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

The duplicated route control flow lives inside `AgentSession`. Extensions can customize compaction content via `session_before_compact` hooks, but they cannot unify internal caller behavior, append semantics, context rebuilds, or core event ordering from outside the session.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts` is the highest-churn upstream file. Rebase conflict resolution must preserve the `_executeCompaction()` pipeline and keep branch summarization outside this helper.

### Migration notes

If upstream modifies any compaction route (manual, threshold, overflow, pre-prompt), resolve conflicts by routing the modified logic through `_executeCompaction()` rather than restoring inline duplication. Preserve the 6-route coverage: manual, threshold, overflow-recovery, pre-prompt, extension-triggered, and branch summarization (which routes through the hook but remains a separate caller). Keep the pre-append token simulation step to prevent post-compaction overflow.

## builtin extension labels

- Changed `src/core/extensions/builtin/index.ts` and `src/core/resource-loader.ts` so builtin extensions keep stable synthetic ids like `<builtin:todowrite>` instead of being loaded as numbered inline factories.
- This was changed in core because the startup Extensions list is sourced from extension metadata produced by `DefaultResourceLoader`; the extension API cannot rename builtin factory identities after load.
- Expected merge-conflict zone on upstream sync: builtin extension registration in `src/core/extensions/builtin/index.ts` and builtin factory loading in `src/core/resource-loader.ts`.

## move selected defaults to global extensions

- Changed `src/core/extensions/builtin/index.ts` and `src/core/resource-loader.ts` so `diff`, `files`, `prompt-url-widget`, and `tps` are no longer registered as builtin factories.
- `DefaultResourceLoader` now seeds generated shim files for those four defaults into the real global `agentDir/extensions/` directory, so they load through normal global extension discovery instead of builtin registration.
- `DefaultResourceLoader` now rewrites previously generated shim files when their absolute builtin module paths become stale after the checkout/package directory moves or is renamed.
- This had to be done in core because builtin-vs-global extension ownership is determined during resource bootstrap, before any extension code runs.
- Expected merge-conflict zone on upstream sync: builtin extension registration and early resource bootstrap in `src/core/resource-loader.ts`.

## disable builtin extensions from settings

- Changed `src/core/settings-manager.ts` and `src/core/resource-loader.ts` so `settings.json` can disable selected builtin extensions with `disabledBuiltinExtensions`.
- `DefaultResourceLoader` now skips builtin factories whose ids are listed in settings.
- This had to be done in core because builtin extensions are instantiated during early resource bootstrap, before project extensions can intercept or unregister them.
- Expected merge-conflict zone on upstream sync: settings schema/getters in `src/core/settings-manager.ts` and builtin factory loading in `src/core/resource-loader.ts`.

## steering default mode to all

- Changed `src/core/settings-manager.ts` so `getSteeringMode()` now defaults to `"all"` instead of `"one-at-a-time"` when no explicit setting is present.
- Added `test/settings-manager.test.ts` coverage to lock the new default behavior.
- This was changed in core because the default steering mode is injected into `Agent` during session creation via `SettingsManager`, so an extension cannot change the built-in default before the session runtime is constructed.
- Expected merge-conflict zone on upstream sync: `src/core/settings-manager.ts` default getter behavior.

## builtin openai service tier setting

- Changed `src/core/settings-manager.ts`, `src/core/extensions/builtin/index.ts`, and added `src/core/extensions/builtin/service-tier.ts` so `settings.json` can set `openai.serviceTier` and automatically inject `service_tier` into OpenAI Responses payloads.
- Added test coverage in `test/suite/service-tier-extension.test.ts`, `test/suite/service-tier-settings.test.ts`, and updated builtin extension registration coverage in `test/resource-loader.test.ts`.
- This was changed in core because builtin extension registration and settings schema/getter wiring happen before extension code can discover a new builtin id or read typed settings from the existing settings manager.
- Expected merge-conflict zone on upstream sync: builtin extension registration in `src/core/extensions/builtin/index.ts` and settings schema/getter additions in `src/core/settings-manager.ts`.

## synced builtin extensions and webfetch

- Changed `src/core/extensions/builtin/index.ts`, `src/core/resource-loader.ts`, and `src/core/settings-manager.ts` so builtin extensions can be allowlisted with `enabledBuiltinExtensions` while preserving `disabledBuiltinExtensions` as an override.
- Added `src/core/extensions/builtin/webfetch/` as a builtin extension synced from `../pi-extensions/pi-webfetch`, and moved `bash-timeout` and `openai-api-parallel-tool-calls` to synced `../pi-extensions` layouts.
- Added `scripts/sync-builtin-extensions.mjs`, wired into the package build, so local builds refresh the vendored builtin snapshots from `SENPI_BUILTIN_EXTENSIONS_SOURCE` or `../pi-extensions` when that source checkout exists. `external-versions.json` records the source package names and versions included in the snapshot.
- This had to be done in core because builtin extension registration and builtin settings filtering happen before any user extension can affect resource discovery.
- Expected merge-conflict zone on upstream sync: builtin extension registration in `src/core/extensions/builtin/index.ts`, builtin factory filtering in `src/core/resource-loader.ts`, and settings schema/getters in `src/core/settings-manager.ts`.

## Anthropic "max" thinking level and provider/model extraBody config

- Widened the `"max"` thinking level through the coding agent surface: CLI `--thinking max`, `/settings` selector, Shift+Tab cycle, `settings.json` `defaultThinkingLevel`, thinking border color mapping.
- Extended `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts` so `models.json` (and `pi.registerProvider()`) accepts `extraBody` at both provider and per-model level. `getApiKeyAndHeaders` now resolves `extraBody`, and `sdk.ts` merges provider/model extraBody with any call-site `extraBody` before invoking `streamSimple`.
- This had to be done in core because `ThinkingLevel` is exported from `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core` and every UI/CLI/settings surface needed to be widened, and because `getApiKeyAndHeaders` + stream option composition live in core `ModelRegistry`/`sdk.ts`.
- Expected merge-conflict zone on upstream sync: `model-registry.ts` schemas + `getApiKeyAndHeaders`, `sdk.ts` stream option composition, `cli/args.ts` validator, `settings-manager.ts` thinking level type, `agent-session.ts` thinking cycle list, interactive TUI thinking selector and border color map.

## RPC prompt-level thinking and fallback level events (2026-07-22)

### What changed

- `agent-session.ts`: accepts a session-only `PromptOptions.thinkingLevel`, rejects queued prompts carrying it before queue mutation, and emits `thinking_level_changed` when retry fallback applies an ephemeral level.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Prompt preflight, session-only level application, fallback model switching, and session event emission are private core lifecycle boundaries.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `agent-session.ts` prompt serialization and fallback model-switch logic.

## Extension event bus follows the loaded generation into runtime (2026-08-11)

`LoadExtensionsResult` now retains the event bus used to construct extension APIs, and
`AgentSession` passes that exact bus into `ExtensionRunner`. RPC subscriptions must bind to this
generation-owned bus rather than an unrelated runtime or resource-loader instance, especially after
extension reloads. Test extension results preserve the same ownership contract.
## Preserve extension event bus after project trust resolution (2026-08-11)

The trusted/untrusted extension result composition now carries forward the shared event bus used by
both pre-trust and remaining extensions. Dropping it caused `ExtensionRunner` to allocate an
unrelated fallback bus, silently disconnecting `pi.rpc.emit` on trust-requiring projects.

## 2026-08-25 - reject upstream Radius session sharing artifacts

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/radius.ts`: intentionally absent from Senpi; upstream Radius sharing is rejected under the fork sharing policy.

### Why

- Senpi retains its gist-based `/share` flow and `pi.dev` viewer instead of adopting the upstream Radius service.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Sharing implementation ownership is a core product policy decision, not an extension-level adaptation.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- NONE: the upstream-only Radius artifact remains excluded from the fork tree.

## 2026-08-25 - Preserve upstream session event behavior

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` retains fork queue and compaction behavior while adopting upstream custom-message ordering.

### Why

- Session event ordering is a provider and persistence runtime contract.

### Why this lives in the fork

- Agent session orchestration executes below extension interception.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- Agent event dispatch and custom-message queue handling.

## 2026-09-03 - Reconcile upstream agent-session admission and runtime replacement

### What changed and why

- Kept senpi compaction admission, abort, model persistence, and event-union behavior while removing the obsolete queued-message gate and callback re-sample from next-turn refresh; runtime replacement now settles the outgoing session before creating the fork target and preserves extension spill reporting.

### Why

- Upstream loop ordering already drains continuation messages into loop-local state before preparation, so the old gate skipped required threshold compaction. Settling before fork creation preserves outgoing JSONL and active-turn lifecycle ordering.

### Why an extension could not handle this

- Session admission, persistence, abort, and runtime replacement are core lifecycle boundaries below extension interception.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `src/core/agent-session.ts` next-turn refresh and compaction lifecycle; `src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts` replacement ordering.

## 2026-09-06 - Optional compaction model override for Claude SDK OAuth

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: resolves an optional `compaction.model` provider/model override for default compaction summarization, while preserving session-model lifecycle bookkeeping and falling back to the session model for malformed or unknown overrides.

### Why

- Claude SDK OAuth lanes can retain a resident SDK session whose native compaction does not fire; users need a reliable senpi-owned summarization escape hatch on a separate model.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Model resolution, summarization authentication, and the core compaction execution request are session lifecycle boundaries below extension interception.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` around `_resolveCompactionModel()` and `_executeCompaction()` default summarization request construction.

## 2026-09-06 - Thread compaction model overrides through settings

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: preserves the optional `compaction.model` provider/model value in the resolved compaction settings returned to core and extensions.

### Why

- The compaction executor and lane policy need one resolved settings path so the override is applied consistently without changing unrelated session settings.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Settings resolution is owned by the core settings manager and occurs before extension contexts consume the resolved compaction settings.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` `Settings.compaction` typing and `getCompactionSettings()` return value.
## 2026-09-06 - Fail closed when recovery fallback cannot admit context

### What changed

- packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts now preserves the active
  session model and ends retry recovery deterministically when a fallback
  candidate fails the live context usability admission check.

### Why

- Authentication and compaction failures could otherwise advance through
  unrelated fallback providers after a candidate was already proven unable to
  hold the live session context.

### Why this lives in the fork

- Retry ownership and fallback switching are core `AgentSession` behavior below
  the extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `_handleRetryableError` fallback admission in
  packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts.
## 2026-09-06 - Make fallback activation atomic for unusable candidates

### What changed

- packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts performs model-select hooks
  and usability admission before persisting or emitting a model change.
- packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/controller.ts reserves fallback
  candidates only after a successful model switch.

### Why

- An over-budget fallback could mutate session state and announce a rejected
  model before admission failed, causing false model-change/retry events and
  leaking the typed usability error.

### Why this lives in the fork

- Retry ownership, model admission, and fallback switching are core session
  behavior below the extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: fallback switch admission in
  packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts and candidate reservation in
  packages/coding-agent/src/core/retry-fallback/controller.ts.



## 2026-09-12 - Upstream sync (upstream/main@71dca871) integration repairs

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts`: fork `AgentSessionLaunchProfile` (immutable cwd/permission/creation-model/thinking flags), settle-before-replacement and `session_extensions_removed` reporting, plus upstream's import path: `reserveSessionWrite(destinationPath)` followed by `copyFileSync(..., COPYFILE_EXCL)` when the source is not already stored.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: fork structure throughout (admission accounting, `compactBeforeNextAdmission` instead of upstream's `_compactBeforeNextAssistantResponse`, `preflightToolCall`/`_emitAfterToolCallHooks`, constants and tool-result truncation, input ids `${sessionId}:${n}` with `emitInputDisposition`/`throwIfCancelled`, `expandPromptTemplateWithMetadata` + `command_invocation`) with upstream behavior ported in: `_getCompactionSettings(forModel)` at every compaction read (D-L), retry delay `min(planner delay, settings.maxAgentDelayMs)` (D-M), and `steer`/`followUp` running input handlers through `_queueUserInput(text, images, behavior, { enqueueOrder, source })` (D-N).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts`: fork bindings `app.history.search` (ctrl+r), `app.tree.editMessage` (ctrl+e), `app.models.toggleFavorite` (ctrl+f) and the Windows/WSL defaults, alongside upstream's `app.thinking.save`; `isRecord`/`hasOwn` helpers for the config parse.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/messages.ts`: fork `ConfigurationUpdateMessage`, context-excluded custom messages (`GOAL_CONTINUATION_MESSAGE_TYPE`), provenance copying, `dropFailedAssistantTurns` as the final transform, and the transport image budget (`elideOldImages`, `convertToLlmForTransport`, placeholders); upstream's `fromId: string | null` widening landed.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`: fork `AuthStorage`-backed registry (`create`/`inMemory`, `modelRuntime` getter, availability snapshot fallback, `getUpstreamModelId`/`getServiceTier`, `extraBody` in compatibility headers) with upstream's `stream()`/`streamSimple()` passthroughs.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts`: fork defaults (`openai-codex` gpt-5.6-sol, ollama, cursor `auto`), `AvailableModelsSource`, stored-reference resolution, pattern ownership metadata, service-tier and thinking provenance; upstream's `radius: "balanced"` default restored.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`: fork runtime (wire identity set at import, credential pool slots and rotation stream, remote catalog provider, `withPayloadRequestMetadata`, `isFallbackEligible`, `hasFreshAvailabilitySnapshot`, `reloadConfig`, native provider registration); upstream's `streamDeferred` split adopted.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `_setSessionFile` keeps the fork reader contract (headerless file -> fresh in-memory id, never a replacement file, resident-store externalize, `mutationCount` bump) and upstream's `_loadEntries` + `inMemory(cwd, options, entries)` ingestion was extended with the same store handling.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts`: `export type * from "./settings-public-types.ts"` stays (upstream's inline `CompactionSettings`/`RetrySettings` moved into the fork type modules); compaction getters take `forModel?` and keep the fork return type `ResolvedCompactionSettings & { model?: string }`; `getRetrySettings()` returns `maxAgentDelayMs` defaulting to pi-ai's `DEFAULT_MAX_AGENT_RETRY_DELAY_MS` and `maxRetries` from the senpi default retry profile.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts`: the fork `<skill_roots>` alias table and stronger loading sentence, rendered for both the read and upstream's new bash-only `fileReadTool` branch.

### Why

- The session loop, model runtime and settings model carry the fork's admission/compaction policy, credential pooling, Astra configuration replay and retry profiles; upstream's per-model compaction budgets, retry cap and queued-input handlers were folded into those shapes rather than replacing them.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- These are the core session, registry and settings classes that extensions receive; their constructors, getters and event contracts cannot be swapped from an extension.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` (`prompt`, `steer`/`followUp`, `_queueUserInput`, compaction and retry blocks); `packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` compaction/retry getters; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` loaders.
- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts` stream wrappers; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts` availability methods; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/messages.ts` `convertToLlm`.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/keybindings.ts` binding table; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-resolver.ts` defaults map; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts` prompt text; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session-runtime.ts` import path.

## 2026-09-15 - Resident store blob backing + idle materialized-view release

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-resident-store.ts`: eviction now has a recoverable backing. When the resident budget is exceeded, the least-recently-used string is written to a lazily-resolved blob directory (temp file + rename) before being dropped from the map; `materialize` hydrates evicted strings from that directory without re-entering the resident cache, so a bulk read cannot refill the budget. Without a backing directory eviction is disabled entirely — strings stay resident beyond the budget because dropping them would leave consumers holding unreadable sentinel tokens (previously reachable for in-memory sessions over 64 MiB). `clear()` wipes the blob cache along with the map; `stats()` gained `evictedCount`/`evictedBytes`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: persisted sessions configure the store with `<sessionDir>/resident-blobs/<sessionId>` (`--no-session` resolves to no directory and never writes blobs), and a new `dropMaterializedCaches()` releases `entriesCache`, `branchCache`, and `compactEntriesCache`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: `_emitAgentIdleAfterDeferredTurns()` releases the memoized materialized views right before emitting `agent_idle`. Materialized entries hold the full persisted strings, so views kept between turns pinned the entire session text in resident memory while idle (measured: an idle session held ~1.1 GB dirty JS heap on macOS via `footprint`; the store budget alone bounded only its own map while the views re-pinned everything).

### Why

- The store's 64 MiB budget bounded only its own map. `getEntries()` memoizes fully materialized entries, so the last read before idle kept every large tool result alive, and recovery for evicted strings re-parsed the entire session JSONL per missing entry (`loadEntriesFromFile` inside `_materializeEntry`). The blob backing makes recovery O(string) via one small file read while the session file remains authoritative: a missing or corrupt blob falls back to the existing batched JSONL recovery unchanged.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `entriesCache`/`branchCache`/`compactEntriesCache` are private `SessionManager` state and the `agent_idle` settle boundary is private `AgentSession` orchestration; no extension hook can release these views at the right time, and the recovery path lives inside the store's own materialization.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-resident-store.ts` internals; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` constructor tail and the block after `getEntries()`; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` `_emitAgentIdleAfterDeferredTurns` tail.

## 2026-09-16 - Resident store review fixes (branch-token baking, blob integrity, dir leaks, idle state)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-resident-store.ts`: blobs are JSON envelopes (`{v:1,text}`) and `_readBlob` validates them, so a truncated or mangled blob falls back to JSONL recovery instead of hydrating garbage; `externalizeString` consults an `idsByText` reverse index (deleted on eviction/spill/clear) so re-externalizing the same resident text is idempotent instead of double-counting bytes; new `externalizeInPlace()`/`materializeInPlace()` mutate nested string fields in place (object identity preserved) and `resolvedBlobsDir()` exposes the active backing.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `createBranchedSession()` materializes the branched entries via `_materializeEntries()` BEFORE clearing the store, so re-externalization can no longer bake sentinel tokens into the new branched JSONL; `_resetToNewSession()` and the branch path capture and remove the previous session's blob directory that `clear()` could no longer reach after the session-id switch; new `getResidentStore()` accessor.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the idle settle now also tokenizes `agent.state.messages` in place (the runtime copies that pinned the same large strings the views pinned); `prepareNextTurnWithContext` and `transformContext` re-materialize them, so every provider request and every per-turn consumer reads real strings.
- `test/suite/harness.ts`: `getUserTexts`/`getAssistantTexts` materialize through the store — post-idle runtime state legitimately holds tokens.

### Why

- ChatGPT-web review of PR #1726/#1729 confirmed four defects: branch-time token baking, missing blob corruption detection, old-session blob-directory leaks, and idle retention through agent state. Each fix keeps the session file authoritative: corruption and hydration misses still fall back to the existing batched JSONL recovery.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- All four fixes live inside private store/`SessionManager`/`AgentSession` lifecycles (ordering around `clear()`, the blobsDir provider, and the idle settle boundary); extensions never see these transition points.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `core/session-resident-store.ts` (blob envelope + reverse index); `core/session-manager.ts` (`_resetToNewSession`, `createBranchedSession`); `core/agent-session.ts` (idle settle, `transformContext`, `prepareNextTurnWithContext` wrappers).

## 2026-09-15 - Spill resident strings to the blob backing across compaction

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-resident-store.ts`: new `spillResident()` writes every resident string to the blob backing and empties the map while keeping the backing itself, unlike `clear()` which wipes both.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `_trimMirrorAfterCompaction()` spills instead of clearing, so strings referenced by the retained mirror (and by branches over pre-compaction history) keep hydrating from the backing after compaction instead of falling back to the batched full-JSONL reload.

### Why

- The previous compaction path cleared the store, which also dropped the blob cache, pushing every post-compaction read of evicted strings back onto `_loadFullHistoryEntries()` (a full session-file parse). With the spill, compact-context recovery stays O(string) per entry across compaction boundaries.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The mirror-trim path and the store's backing lifecycle are private `SessionManager`/store internals; extensions never see the spill point.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-resident-store.ts` (new method after `clear()`); `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` `_trimMirrorAfterCompaction` one-line change.

## 2026-09-16 - Resident store: content-addressed blobs, token-free runtime reads, bounded blob lifetime

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-resident-store.ts`: blob ids are the SHA-256 hex of the text (the token stays `RESIDENT_STRING_PREFIX + id`); the `idsByText` reverse index and the per-instance counter are gone, so `spillResident()` releases every spilled string and re-externalizing hydrated text maps to the existing blob instead of minting a new file. `_writeBlob` skips a file that already exists (same hash, same bytes) while still counting the eviction; `_readBlob` deletes a blob that fails the envelope check so the next eviction rewrites it. `transformJsonValue` throws `TypeError("Do not know how to serialize a BigInt")` again instead of letting a bigint reach the `WeakSet` cycle guard.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts`: the idle settle releases the materialized views and tokenizes `agent.state.messages` only when `residentStore.stats().evictedCount > 0` (the release frees memory only for blob-hydrated strings) and sets a latch; `get messages()`, `prepareNextTurnWithContext`, and the out-of-turn token estimators (`_estimateCompactionLogTokens`, `_blockedAdmissionContentTokens`, `_resolveThresholdContextTokens`, the compaction-threshold estimate, `_shouldCompact`) read through `_runtimeMessages()`, which hydrates the runtime array in place when the latch is set. `dispose()` disposes the session manager.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: `dispose()` removes the blob directory and unregisters the session writer; `_setSessionFile` clears a stale `resident-blobs/<sessionId>` directory when a persisted session is opened or recovered.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/harness.ts`: `getUserTexts`/`getAssistantTexts` read plain message text again (the store wrapper was a symptom of the token leak).

### Why

- Review of PRs #1726/#1729 (issue #1746) found: spilled strings pinned by the reverse-index keys; a bigint crashing with `WeakSet values must be objects`; `session.messages` exposing resident tokens between `agent_idle` and the next turn; per-process numeric ids creating a new blob per re-externalize and colliding across processes on one session directory; the idle release re-materializing the full history every turn even when nothing was evicted; and no blob-directory cleanup on writer teardown or session reopen.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Blob naming, the idle settle boundary, the runtime message accessor, and the session-writer lifecycle are private store/`SessionManager`/`AgentSession` internals; extensions observe none of these transition points.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `core/session-resident-store.ts` (id derivation, `_writeBlob`/`_readBlob`); `core/agent-session.ts` (`_emitAgentIdleAfterDeferredTurns`, `get messages`, estimator call sites, `dispose`); `core/session-manager.ts` (`_setSessionFile`, new `dispose`).

### 2026-09-16 addendum - the last owner clears the blob directory

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-write-reservation.ts`: new `hasOtherLiveSessionWriter(path, self)` answers whether another live persisted writer still owns a session file, pruning collected refs like `liveSessionWritePaths()` does.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`: both blob-directory releases (the stale clear in `_setSessionFile` and `dispose()`) go through `_releaseBlobsDirUnlessShared()`, which keeps the directory while another live manager owns the same session file. The app-server loads a thread that is already open (`modes/app-server/threads/registry.ts` disposes the duplicate `AgentSession`), and without this the duplicate's teardown took the live manager's cache, costing it a full JSONL recovery per evicted string.
